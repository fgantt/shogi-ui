# Endgame tablebase positions
# Format: fen,expected_outcome
# Notes:
# - expected_outcome: win|loss|draw
# - Only positions solvable by built-in micro tablebase solvers will yield results.
# - Leave additional rows commented if uncertain.

# Candidate K+G vs K position (may depend on FEN parser conventions). If solvable, expect win.
