# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Attack Pattern Mirroring

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Affected**: All White piece moves (Gold, Silver, Knight, Promoted pieces)

---

## Bug Description

The AI engine was generating **illegal moves** for White pieces, specifically Gold generals. For example, in an 8-piece handicap game, the AI recommended `6a4b` (moving a gold 2 squares diagonally), which violates gold movement rules.

### Root Cause

The attack pattern precomputation used **horizontal mirroring** (flipping columns) to convert Black's attack patterns to White's patterns. This is **fundamentally wrong** for Shogi because:

- **Black** plays from bottom → top (toward rank 9)
- **White** plays from top → bottom (toward rank 1)

The orientation difference requires **vertical mirroring** (flipping rows), not horizontal mirroring.

---

## Example of the Bug

### Before Fix (WRONG)
For a White gold at `6a` (file 6, rank 9):
- Horizontal mirroring would give incorrect attack squares
- Generated move: `6a4b` (2 squares diagonally!) ❌

### After Fix (CORRECT)  
For a White gold at `6a`:
- Vertical mirroring correctly mirrors Black's pattern across rows
- Legal moves: `6b`, `7a`, `5a`, `7b`, `5b` (1 square in 6 directions) ✅

---

## Impact

### Affected Pieces
All orientation-dependent pieces for White player:
- ❌ Gold (金)
- ❌ Silver (銀)
- ❌ Knight (桂)
- ❌ Promoted Pawn (と金)
- ❌ Promoted Lance (成香)
- ❌ Promoted Knight (成桂)
- ❌ Promoted Silver (成銀)

### Symptoms
- AI generates illegal moves for White
- Moves rejected by tsshogi validation
- Game ends immediately with "Illegal Move" victory for Black
- Especially visible in handicap games where White moves first

---

## Fix Implementation

### File Changed
`src/bitboards/attack_patterns.rs`

### Changes Made

1. **Renamed function** (line 348-362):
   ```rust
   // BEFORE (WRONG):
   fn mirror_pattern_horizontally(&self, pattern: Bitboard) -> Bitboard {
       let mirrored_col = 8 - col;  // Flips columns ❌
       let mirrored_square = row * 9 + mirrored_col;
   }
   
   // AFTER (CORRECT):
   fn mirror_pattern_vertically(&self, pattern: Bitboard) -> Bitboard {
       let mirrored_row = 8 - row;  // Flips rows ✅
       let mirrored_square = mirrored_row * 9 + col;
   }
   ```

2. **Updated all call sites** (lines 167-227):
   - Changed all `mirror_pattern_horizontally()` calls to `mirror_pattern_vertically()`
   - Updated comments to reflect correct mirroring approach
   - 7 piece types updated (Knight, Gold, Silver, +4 promoted pieces)

## Testing

### Test Case
- **Game**: 8-piece handicap (White missing R, B, L, N)
- **Position**: `3gkg3/9/ppppppppp/9/9/9/PPPPPPPPP/1B5R1/LNSGKGSNL w - 1`
- **AI Level**: 1
- **Expected**: White should generate only legal moves
- **Before Fix**: Generated `6a4b` (illegal) ❌
- **After Fix**: Should generate legal gold moves only ✅

### Verification Steps
1. Start 8-piece handicap game (Human vs AI)
2. Let AI (White) make first move
3. Verify move is legal and accepted by tsshogi
4. No "Illegal Move" game over should occur

---

## Additional Notes

### Why This Bug Wasn't Caught Earlier
- Most testing was done with standard games where Black moves first
- Black's patterns were correct (no mirroring needed)
- Handicap games where White moves first exposed the bug
- The illegal move detection system correctly caught it, but prevented gameplay

### Performance Impact
- ✅ No performance impact - same O(1) pattern lookup
- ✅ WASM size unchanged
- ✅ Only changes pattern transformation logic

---

## Validation

- ✅ Rust compilation successful
- ✅ Production build successful  
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Ready for testing with handicap games
