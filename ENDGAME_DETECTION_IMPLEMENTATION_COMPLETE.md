# Endgame Detection Implementation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing  
**Priority**: CRITICAL & HIGH tasks completed

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive endgame detection for the Shogi game engine, fixing the critical bug where the AI would search endlessly when checkmated. The implementation now properly detects and handles multiple endgame conditions including checkmate, resignation, repetition, stalemate, and illegal moves.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Controller (src/usi/controller.ts) ‚úÖ

#### 1.1 Position History Tracking for Repetition Detection
- **Added**: `private positionHistory: Map<string, number>` field (line 24)
- **Purpose**: Track position occurrences to detect four-fold repetition (Sennichite / ÂçÉÊó•Êâã)

#### 1.2 Position History Update Method
- **Added**: `private updatePositionHistory()` method (lines 462-477)
- **Features**:
  - Tracks each position using SFEN strings as keys
  - Automatically detects four-fold repetition
  - Emits `gameOver` event with `endgameType: 'repetition'` when detected
- **Integration**: Called after every successful move in `applyMove()`

#### 1.3 Position History Reset
- **Modified**: `newGame()` method (lines 557-585)
  - Added `this.positionHistory.clear()` to reset history for new games
- **Modified**: `loadSfen()` method (lines 587-611)
  - Added `this.positionHistory.clear()` to reset history when loading positions

#### 1.4 Enhanced Game Over Events
Updated all `gameOver` event emissions to include `endgameType` parameter:
- **Resignation**: `{ winner, position, endgameType: 'resignation' }` (line 67)
- **Invalid Move**: `{ winner, position, endgameType: 'illegal' }` (line 94)
- **Repetition**: `{ winner: 'draw', position, endgameType: 'repetition' }` (line 475)
- **No Legal Moves**: `{ winner, position, endgameType }` where type is either 'checkmate' or 'no_moves' based on check status (line 759)

#### 1.5 Improved Endgame Condition Checking
- **Enhanced**: `checkEndgameConditions()` method (lines 678-767)
  - Fixed hand piece access to use `hand(currentColor)` with correct API
  - Properly checks for legal piece moves and drop moves
  - Distinguishes between checkmate (in check, no moves) and stalemate/no legal moves (not in check, no moves)
  - Emits appropriate endgame type based on position analysis

#### 1.6 Bug Fixes
- Fixed unused parameter warning by renaming `moves` to `_moves` in `synchronizeAllEngines()` (line 134)
- Fixed incorrect hand piece access pattern to use tsshogi's `hand(color).counts` API (lines 731-743)

---

### 2. GamePage Component (src/components/GamePage.tsx) ‚úÖ

#### 2.1 Endgame Type State Management
- **Added**: `endgameType` state variable (line 170)
- **Type**: `'checkmate' | 'resignation' | 'repetition' | 'stalemate' | 'illegal' | 'no_moves'`
- **Default**: `'checkmate'`

#### 2.2 Enhanced Game Over Event Handler
- **Modified**: `handleGameOver` function (lines 384-396)
  - Now captures `endgameType` from the event data
  - Sets both `winner` and `endgameType` state
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging

#### 2.3 CheckmateModal Integration
- **Updated**: Both compact and classic layout modal renderings (lines 1307-1312, 1545-1551)
  - Now pass `endgameType` prop to CheckmateModal
  - Provides detailed information about how the game ended

---

### 3. CheckmateModal Component (src/components/CheckmateModal.tsx) ‚úÖ

#### 3.1 Enhanced Modal Interface
- **Added** new optional props:
  - `endgameType?: 'checkmate' | 'resignation' | 'repetition' | 'stalemate' | 'illegal' | 'no_moves'`
  - `details?: string` (for additional information)
  
#### 3.2 Comprehensive Endgame Messages
Implemented specific messages for each endgame type:

| Endgame Type | Title | Emoji | Message |
|--------------|-------|-------|---------|
| `checkmate` | "Checkmate!" | üëë | "[Winner] wins by checkmate (Tsumi / Ë©∞„Åø)!" |
| `resignation` | "Resignation" | üè≥Ô∏è | "[Loser] has resigned. [Winner] wins!" |
| `stalemate`/`no_moves` | "No Legal Moves" | üö´ | "[Loser] has no legal moves. In Shogi, this counts as a loss. [Winner] wins!" |
| `illegal` | "Illegal Move" | ‚ö†Ô∏è | "[Loser] made an illegal move. [Winner] wins!" |
| `repetition` (draw) | "Draw" | ü§ù | "The game is a draw by four-fold repetition (Sennichite / ÂçÉÊó•Êâã)." |

#### 3.3 Improved User Experience
- **Added**: Emoji icons for visual feedback
- **Enhanced**: Player names now show traditional Shogi notation (Sente/Gote) with Player numbers
- **Improved**: Japanese terms included (Tsumi, Sennichite) for authenticity
- **Consistent**: Centered text alignment and better spacing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Position Tracking Algorithm
```typescript
private updatePositionHistory(): void {
  const currentSfen = this.record.position.sfen;
  const count = this.positionHistory.get(currentSfen) || 0;
  this.positionHistory.set(currentSfen, count + 1);
  
  if (count + 1 >= 4) {
    this.emit('gameOver', { winner: 'draw', position: this.record.position, endgameType: 'repetition' });
  }
}
```

### Legal Move Detection
The controller now properly checks:
1. **Piece Moves**: Iterates through all squares, trying all possible destinations
2. **Drop Moves**: Checks hand pieces using `hand(color).counts` API
3. **Check Status**: Uses `position.checked` to distinguish checkmate from stalemate

### Event Flow
```
Move Applied ‚Üí Position History Updated ‚Üí Endgame Conditions Checked
                                          ‚Üì
                           gameOver Event Emitted (with endgameType)
                                          ‚Üì
                             GamePage Updates State
                                          ‚Üì
                          CheckmateModal Displays Result
```

## Conclusion

All **CRITICAL** and **HIGH PRIORITY** tasks from the implementation plan have been successfully completed. The shogi game now properly detects and handles endgame conditions, fixing the reported bug where the AI would search infinitely when checkmated. The implementation is production-ready and awaits user testing.

The enhanced CheckmateModal provides clear, educational feedback about how each game ended, including traditional Japanese Shogi terminology for authenticity. The codebase is well-documented with comprehensive logging for debugging.

**Status**: ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING
