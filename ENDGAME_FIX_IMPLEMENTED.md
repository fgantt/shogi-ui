# Endgame Detection Fix - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Testing  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## Summary

Fixed the critical bug where the AI would search endlessly when checkmated and panic with overflow errors. The game now properly detects when a player has no legal moves and displays the CheckmateModal.

**Key fixes**:
1. Added `checkGameOver()` function in UI to detect no legal moves
2. Added controller event handling for AI resignation
3. **Fixed Rust panic** - Added early legal move check before search to prevent overflow
4. **Fixed infinite loop** - Check if AI move application succeeds before requesting another move

## Changes Made

### 1. Implemented checkGameOver() Function
**File**: `src/components/GamePage.tsx` (lines 38-127)

Created a comprehensive function that:
- Checks all squares for pieces belonging to the current player
- Tests all possible moves (including promotions) using `position.createMove()` and `position.isValidMove()`
- Checks for legal drop moves from hand pieces
- Returns the winner ('player1', 'player2', or null)
- Includes console logging for debugging

**Key Logic**:
```typescript
// Check piece moves (all 81 source squares √ó 81 destination squares)
for each piece on board:
  for each possible destination:
    if (move is valid):
      hasLegalMoves = true

// Check drop moves if no piece moves found
for each piece type in hand:
  for each empty square:
    if (drop is valid):
      hasLegalMoves = true

if (!hasLegalMoves):
  return winner (opponent of current player)
```

### 2. Wired checkGameOver to State Changes
**File**: `src/components/GamePage.tsx` (lines 541-547)

Added game over detection in the `onStateChanged` callback:
- Calls `checkGameOver(newPosition)` after each move
- Sets winner state if game is over
- Includes logging to verify detection

### 3. Handle AI Resignation and Invalid Moves
**File**: `src/usi/controller.ts` (lines 42-69)

Updated the bestmove event handler to:
- Check if `usiMove === 'resign'` or `!usiMove`
- Calculate winner based on current turn
- Emit `gameOver` event with winner information
- Return early to prevent further processing
- **NEW**: Check if `applyMove()` succeeds before continuing
- **NEW**: If move application fails, declare game over (position is checkmate)
- **NEW**: Prevents infinite loop when AI returns invalid moves

**Critical fix**: The AI was returning moves like `P*5h` that failed to apply (because they don't escape check), but we weren't checking if the move application succeeded. This caused an infinite loop where the same invalid move was requested repeatedly.

### 4. Added gameOver Event Listener
**File**: `src/components/GamePage.tsx` (lines 333-345)

Created a React effect that:
- Listens for `gameOver` events from the controller
- Updates winner state when event is received
- Logs the event for debugging
- Cleans up the listener on unmount

### 5. Fixed Rust Panic on Overflow
**File**: `src/lib.rs` (lines 385-400)

Added early legal move check in `get_best_move()` before starting search:
- Generates legal moves before entering iterative deepening
- Returns `None` immediately if no legal moves exist
- Prevents the search engine from panicking with overflow error
- Logs "No legal moves available - game over" message

**Why this was needed**: The search engine was panicking with "attempt to add with overflow" at line 7045 in the aspiration window logic when it encountered a position with no legal moves. By checking for legal moves before starting the search, we avoid this panic entirely.

## How It Works

### Flow for Human vs AI (Human Checkmates AI)

1. **Human makes move** ‚Üí Controller applies move
2. **State changes** ‚Üí `onStateChanged` callback fires
3. **Check game over** ‚Üí `checkGameOver(position)` called
4. **AI's turn** ‚Üí Controller requests AI move
5. **AI has no legal moves** ‚Üí Search engine finds no moves
6. **AI returns null/resign** ‚Üí `bestmove` handler catches it
7. **Game over detected** ‚Üí `gameOver` event emitted
8. **UI updates** ‚Üí `winner` state set
9. **Modal appears** ‚Üí CheckmateModal displays

### Flow for Human vs Human

1. **Player makes move** ‚Üí Controller applies move
2. **State changes** ‚Üí `onStateChanged` callback fires
3. **Check game over** ‚Üí `checkGameOver(position)` called
4. **No legal moves** ‚Üí Function detects no moves for current player
5. **Winner determined** ‚Üí Returns opponent as winner
6. **UI updates** ‚Üí `winner` state set
7. **Modal appears** ‚Üí CheckmateModal displays

### Flow for AI vs AI

1. **AI makes move** ‚Üí Controller applies move
2. **State changes** ‚Üí `onStateChanged` callback fires
3. **Check game over** ‚Üí `checkGameOver(position)` called
4. **Next AI's turn** ‚Üí Controller requests next AI move
5. **AI has no moves** ‚Üí Detected by checkGameOver OR AI returns resign
6. **Game over** ‚Üí Winner set, modal appears

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required

#### ‚úÖ Test 1: Human Checkmates AI
- [ ] Start game: Human (Black) vs AI (White)
- [ ] Play to checkmate the AI
- [ ] **Expected**: CheckmateModal appears immediately
- [ ] **Expected**: Console shows "Game over detected: player1"
- [ ] **Expected**: No infinite search loop
- [ ] **Expected**: "New Game" button works
- [ ] **Expected**: "Review Position" button closes modal

#### ‚úÖ Test 2: AI Checkmates Human
- [ ] Start game: Human (Black) vs AI (White)  
- [ ] Allow AI to checkmate you
- [ ] **Expected**: CheckmateModal appears immediately
- [ ] **Expected**: Console shows "Game over detected: player2"
- [ ] **Expected**: Modal displays correct winner

#### ‚úÖ Test 3: Human vs Human
- [ ] Start game: Human vs Human
- [ ] Play to checkmate
- [ ] **Expected**: CheckmateModal appears
- [ ] **Expected**: Correct winner displayed

#### ‚úÖ Test 4: AI vs AI (if supported)
- [ ] Start game: AI vs AI
- [ ] Let game play out
- [ ] **Expected**: Game ends properly
- [ ] **Expected**: CheckmateModal appears

### Console Logging to Verify

When game over occurs, you should see:
```
State changed, checking for game over...
Checking game over for position: [SFEN string]
Current turn: Black/White
Has legal moves: false
Game over! Winner: player1/player2
Game over detected: player1/player2
```

If AI resigns:
```
AI resigned or has no legal moves, usiMove: null
Emitting gameOver event, winner: player1/player2
Game over event received from controller: player1/player2
```

## Known Limitations

### Performance Consideration
The `checkGameOver()` function tests up to 6,561 possible moves (81√ó81) plus drop moves. This is acceptable for end-game positions (which typically have few pieces), but could be optimized in the future by:
- Early exit on first legal move found ‚úÖ (already implemented)
- Only checking realistic move destinations based on piece type
- Caching results

### Not Yet Implemented
- ‚ùå Repetition detection (Sennichite)
- ‚ùå Impasse detection (Jish≈çgi with 24-point rule)
- ‚ùå Specific illegal move messages (Nifu, Uchifuzume)
- ‚ùå Time loss detection
- ‚ùå Game over sound effects
- ‚ùå Differentendgame types in modal

These are documented in the implementation plan for future work.

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/GamePage.tsx` - Added checkGameOver function and event handling
2. `src/usi/controller.ts` - Added AI resignation handling
3. `src/lib.rs` - Added early legal move check before search to prevent overflow panic

## Build Status

‚úÖ WASM rebuild successful (./build.sh)
‚úÖ TypeScript build successful (npm run build)
‚úÖ No linting errors
‚úÖ No compilation errors
‚úÖ All Rust code compiles without warnings
‚úÖ TypeScript types check out

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** - Follow the testing checklist above
2. **Verify in all game modes**:
   - Human vs AI (both colors)
   - Human vs Human
   - AI vs AI (if supported)
3. **Check console logs** - Verify expected logging appears
4. **Test edge cases**:
   - Stalemate (no moves, not in check) - should still end game
   - Position loaded from SFEN in checkmate
   - Game loaded from save file in checkmate

## Debugging Tips

If game over is not detected:

1. **Check Console** - Look for "Checking game over" logs
2. **Check Move Generation** - Verify `position.createMove()` and `position.isValidMove()` work
3. **Check Event Flow** - Verify `gameOver` event is emitted and received
4. **Check Modal State** - Verify `winner` state is being set

If infinite loop still occurs:

1. **Check AI resignation** - Verify `usiMove` is actually null/resign
2. **Check early return** - Verify controller returns after detecting resignation
3. **Check event propagation** - Ensure `gameOver` event stops AI from requesting more moves

## Success Criteria Met

- ‚úÖ Wired to state changes
- ‚úÖ AI resignation handled
- ‚úÖ GameOver events propagate to UI
- ‚úÖ CheckmateModal component hooked up
