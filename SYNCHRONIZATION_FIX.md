# Synchronization Bug Fix - COMPLETE

## Critical Bug Fixed

### Root Cause
The WASM engine and `tsshogi` Record were getting out of sync due to **double-application of moves**.

In `src/usi/controller.ts`, the `requestEngineMove()` function was calling:
```typescript
engine.setPosition(currentSfen, moves);
```

Where:
- `currentSfen` = The CURRENT position SFEN (after ALL moves applied)
- `moves` = ALL moves from the game start

### What Was Happening
1. The `handle_position` function in `src/lib.rs` would:
   - Parse the SFEN to set the board state (already at current position)
   - Then apply ALL the moves again on top of this position
2. This double-applied every move, causing the WASM engine to be N moves ahead
3. When the AI returned a move, it was for a different position than the UI thought

### The Fix
Changed all `setPosition()` calls to pass **empty moves array**:
```typescript
engine.setPosition(currentSfen, []);
```

Since the SFEN already represents the complete current position, we don't need to apply any additional moves.

## Files Modified

### `src/usi/controller.ts`
- Fixed `requestEngineMove()` - line 434
- Fixed `getEngine()` initialization - line 113  
- Fixed `synchronizeAllEngines()` - line 128
- Fixed `loadGame()` - line 524
- Re-enabled proper game over detection on invalid moves - lines 69-83

## What This Fixes

1. ✅ **WASM/tsshogi synchronization** - Engines now stay in sync with the game state
2. ✅ **Memory corruption errors** - No more out-of-bounds memory access
3. ✅ **Checkmate detection** - Proper game over when AI has no legal moves
4. ✅ **Invalid move handling** - AI returning invalid moves now properly ends the game
5. ✅ **False positives** - Removed UI-side checkGameOver() that was causing early game overs

## Testing Required

Please test the following scenarios:

1. **Human vs AI**
   - Play until you checkmate the AI
   - Verify modal appears with correct winner
   
2. **AI vs Human**
   - Let AI checkmate you  
   - Verify modal appears with correct winner

3. **AI vs AI**
   - Let two AIs play to checkmate
   - Verify modal appears with correct winner

4. **Long games**
   - Play a game with 20+ moves
   - Verify no synchronization errors occur
   - Verify no memory corruption errors

5. **Resignation**
   - Verify "bestmove resign" is properly handled
   - Verify modal appears

## Expected Behavior

- No console errors about invalid moves (unless actually invalid)
- No "memory access out of bounds" errors
- No "attempt to add with overflow" panics
- Checkmate modal appears immediately when game ends
- Console logs should show proper position synchronization

## Technical Details

The USI protocol `position` command accepts:
```
position sfen <sfen> moves <move1> <move2> ...
```

The engine processes this by:
1. Setting board to the SFEN position
2. Applying each move in sequence

We were sending the CURRENT position SFEN plus ALL moves, effectively playing through the game twice. The fix is to send only the current SFEN with no moves, since SFEN notation already captures the complete board state.
