# Project Overview

This is a web-based Shogi (Japanese Chess) game. The application features a React-based user interface and a Rust-powered game engine compiled to WebAssembly for high-performance game logic.

## Key Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, `react-router-dom`
*   **Backend/Game Logic:** Rust, `wasm-bindgen`
*   **Styling:** CSS, with some specific styles for the game board and components.

## Architecture

The application is structured as a single-page application (SPA) built with React. The core game logic, including move generation, validation, and AI, is implemented in Rust and exposed to the JavaScript environment as a WebAssembly module.

*   `src/App.jsx`: Defines the main application component and routing.
*   `src/components/`: Contains the React components for the UI, such as the game board, pieces, and modals.
*   `src/game/`: Contains the JavaScript side of the game logic, which interfaces with the WebAssembly module.
*   `src/ai/`: Contains the AI logic, including the WebAssembly engine wrapper.
*   `src/lib.rs`: The main Rust source file, which defines the Shogi engine and its API.
*   `pkg/`: This directory contains the compiled WebAssembly module and its JavaScript bindings, generated by `wasm-pack`.

# Building and Running

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
*   Rust and `wasm-pack`

## Development

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a Vite development server and open the application in your browser.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the optimized and minified application files.

## Testing

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

# Development Conventions

## Code Style

*   **JavaScript:** The project uses ESLint for code linting. The configuration can be found in `eslint.config.js`.
*   **Rust:** The Rust code follows standard Rust conventions.

## WebAssembly Integration

The Rust code is compiled to WebAssembly using `wasm-pack`. The `pkg/` directory, which contains the output of the `wasm-pack` build, is committed to the repository. When making changes to the Rust code, you will need to rebuild the WebAssembly module using `wasm-pack`.

## AI Engine

The AI engine is implemented in Rust and exposed to the JavaScript environment via the `ShogiEngine` class in `src/ai/wasmEngine.js`. This class handles the communication between the React components and the WebAssembly module.
