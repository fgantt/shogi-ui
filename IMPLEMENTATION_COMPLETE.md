## 🆕 New Features (Commit 2)

### 1. Impasse Detection (Jishōgi / 持将棋)

**What It Is**: When both kings enter enemy territory (promotion zones), game ends based on point count.

**Implementation**:
- Rust: Full implementation with 24-point rule
- TypeScript: Controller integration with king position tracking
- UI: Special messages for draw vs victory outcomes
- Display: Shows point breakdown (e.g., "Black: 26 points, White: 22 points")

**Rules**:
- Both kings must be in promotion zones (Black in 0-2, White in 6-8)
- Rook/Dragon/Bishop/Horse = 5 points
- King = 0 points
- All others = 1 point
- Both need 24+ for draw, otherwise lower score loses

### 2. Enhanced Illegal Move Prevention

**Nifu (二歩 - Double Pawn)**:
- Enhanced with detailed debug logging
- Prevents pawn drops on files with existing unpromoted pawns
- Clear error messages in console

**Uchifuzume (打ち歩詰め - Pawn Drop Mate)** - NEW:
- Full checkmate verification (not just check detection)
- Simulates the pawn drop
- Checks all 8 king escape squares
- Validates it's actual checkmate before rejecting
- Most comprehensive implementation

### 3. Game Over Sounds

**Victory Sound** (Checkmate/Resignation/Impasse Win):
- 800ms ascending major triad (A, C#, E, A)
- Triumphant and celebratory
- Synthetic audio with smooth envelopes

**Draw Sound** (Repetition/Impasse Draw):
- 500ms neutral tones (C to A)
- Calm and resolving
- Gentle, non-intrusive

**Features**:
- Automatic fallback to synthetic if files missing
- Respects user sound settings
- Web Audio API for quality synthesis

### 4. Game Over Animations

**Modal Entrance**:
- Slide down from top with bounce effect
- 600ms cubic-bezier easing
- Smooth, professional feel

**Overlay**:
- Fade-in with progressive blur
- 500ms smooth transition
- Modern, polished look

**Emoji Effects**:
- Victory: Continuous pulse (1.5s cycle)
- Draw: Soft blue glow (2s cycle)
- Eye-catching, celebratory

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then test these scenarios (see TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md for details):

1. **Checkmate**: Play until one side is checkmated
   - Expected: Modal appears, sound plays, emoji pulses, no infinite loop

2. **Repetition**: Repeat the same position 4 times
   - Expected: Draw declared, draw sound, emoji glows

3. **Impasse**: Create position with both kings advanced
   - Expected: Point counting, appropriate outcome, details shown

4. **Illegal Moves**: Try double pawn or pawn drop mate
   - Expected: Move rejected with debug logging

5. **Modal**: Click "New Game" after game ends
   - Expected: Modal dismisses, StartGameModal opens
