### Key Decisions / Technical Requirements / Strategic Direction - 2025-07-30

**1. Enhanced User Experience & Visual Feedback:**
   - **Goal:** Improve user interaction and visual clarity.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Implemented `getLegalDrops` for valid drop square calculation.
     - Refactored `App.jsx` for deselection logic (clicking selected piece/captured piece again deselects it).
     - Introduced semitransparent overlays for board square highlights (legal moves, in-check, last move).
     - Standardized board square dimensions to `70px` width and `76px` height.
     - `SvgPiece.jsx` now uses unique `piecePath` values and `wood-bambo.jpg` as a fill pattern.
     - Captured pieces display a badge counter for multiples of the same type.
     - Move History table uses Shogi notation and right-to-left column numbering (1-9).

**2. Settings Panel for Customization:**
   - **Goal:** Provide users with options to customize their game experience.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Created `SettingsPanel.jsx` and `settings.css` for a dedicated settings interface.
     - Implemented controls for AI difficulty, piece label display (`kanji` or `english`), wallpaper selection, and board background selection.
     - Added visual feedback (outline) for selected wallpaper and board background images within the settings panel.
     - Ensured `currentWallpaper` and `currentBoardBackground` states are correctly managed in `App.jsx` to reflect selections.

**3. Game Logic Refinements:**
   - **Goal:** Ensure core game mechanics are robust and prevent illegal moves.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Legal moves are now filtered to prevent placing the current player's King in check.
     - AI moves are also filtered to prevent self-check.

**4. UI Control Streamlining:**
   - **Goal:** Simplify the main game interface by centralizing settings.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Removed redundant AI difficulty and piece label dropdowns from `GameControls.jsx`.
     - Consolidated settings access through a new "Settings" button in `GameControls.jsx`.
     - Formatted game controls with dark blue buttons, icons for "New Game", "Undo Move", and "Settings", and a clear display of the current AI level.
