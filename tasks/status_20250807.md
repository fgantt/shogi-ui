        Improve the playing strength of the AI opponent in the Shogi game by enhancing its evaluation function, move ordering, opening book, and search algorithm.
    </overall_goal>

    <key_knowledge>
        - The core AI logic is in `src/ai/ai.worker.js`.
        - The AI's thinking time is set to 1 second for 'easy', 3 seconds for 'medium', and 9 seconds for 'hard'.
        - The quiescence search depth has been increased to 5 for better tactical calculations.
        - The opening book (`src/ai/openingBook.json`) is structured as an array of named opening objects.
        - The AI's search algorithm has been upgraded from minimax with alpha-beta pruning to a more efficient Principal Variation Search (PVS).
        - The `minimax` function has been replaced by a `pvs` function, and a `getPossibleMoves` helper function was created to centralize move generation.
        - The AI's evaluation function has been enhanced with King Safety (now "King Shield") and mobility.
        - The `scoreMove` function was improved to prioritize promotions, recaptures, escaping attacks, and controlling the center.
        - The `getKingSafetyScore` function now implements a more general "King Shield" evaluation, rewarding friendly pieces around the king.

        - CWD: `/Users/fgantt/projects/vibe/shogi-game/shogi-ui`
        - MODIFIED: `src/ai/ai.worker.js` - Replaced the `minimax` algorithm with PVS, refactored move generation, and updated `getKingSafetyScore` to use "King Shield" evaluation.
        - MODIFIED: `src/ai/openingBook.json` - Expanded with "Aigakari (Double Wing Attack)" opening.
        - MODIFIED: `src/game/engine.js` - Removed noisy console logs from `isCheckmate` function.
        - COMMITTED: Previous changes, including enhancing the opening book, updating the "Easy" AI's logic, PVS implementation, and King Safety enhancement.

    <recent_actions>
        - Replaced the `minimax` search algorithm with a more efficient Principal Variation Search (PVS) algorithm in `src/ai/ai.worker.js`.
        - Refactored the move generation logic into a `getPossibleMoves` helper function.
        - Updated the main `getAiMove` function to use the new `pvs` function with iterative deepening.
        - Committed the PVS implementation.
        - Enhanced the AI's king safety evaluation by implementing a "King Shield" logic in `src/ai/ai.worker.js`.
        - Committed the King Safety enhancement.
        - Expanded the AI's opening book with the "Aigakari (Double Wing Attack)" opening in `src/ai/openingBook.json`.
        - Committed the opening book expansion.
        - Removed noisy console logs from the `isCheckmate` function in `src/game/engine.js`.
