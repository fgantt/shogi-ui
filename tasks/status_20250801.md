## Project Status Summary - August 1, 2025

### Recent Accomplishments:

- **Checkmate Implementation:** Implemented checkmate detection logic and a modal to announce the winner, providing options to dismiss or start a new game.
- **Move Notation Enhancements:**
    - Added `=` notation for declined promotions in the move log.
    - Corrected the display of promoted pieces in the move notation to show the original unpromoted piece initial (e.g., `Px73+` instead of `+Px73+`).
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
    - Changed the attacked badge color for Player 2 from blue to green.
    - Removed bold font-weight from the attacked badge.
- **AI Responsiveness:** Addressed UI unresponsiveness during AI's turn by making AI move calculations asynchronous and introducing visual feedback (dimming UI elements).

### Current Challenges/Known Issues:

- **`ReferenceError: isThinking is not defined`:** A persistent `ReferenceError` related to the `isThinking` state variable in `App.jsx` is preventing further progress. Troubleshooting efforts indicate a potential caching or file synchronization issue in the local development environment, as the code appears correct.

### Next Steps:

- Continue to diagnose and resolve the `ReferenceError: isThinking is not defined` to unblock further development.
- Once the `isThinking` error is resolved, verify the AI responsiveness and checkmate functionality thoroughly.
