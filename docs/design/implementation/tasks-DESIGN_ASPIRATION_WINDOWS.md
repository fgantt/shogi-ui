# Task List: Aspiration Windows Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `src/types.rs` - Contains configuration and statistics structures for search optimizations (QuiescenceConfig, LMRConfig, etc.)
- `src/search.rs` - Main search engine implementation with SearchEngine and IterativeDeepening structs
- `tests/aspiration_window_tests.rs` - Unit tests for aspiration window functionality
- `tests/aspiration_window_integration_tests.rs` - Integration tests for aspiration windows with other search features
- `tests/aspiration_window_performance_tests.rs` - Performance benchmarks and regression tests
- `tests/aspiration_window_optimization_tests.rs` - Tests for window sizing algorithms and adaptive behavior

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `cargo test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Cargo configuration.
