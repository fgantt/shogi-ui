## Performance Characteristics

### Piece-Square Tables
- **Lookup Time**: O(1) - Direct array access
- **Memory Usage**: ~5KB (fixed size arrays)
- **Cache Friendly**: Contiguous memory layout

### Pawn Structure
- **Evaluation Time**: O(n) where n = number of pawns (typically < 18)
- **Passed Pawn Check**: O(n) per pawn
- **Doubled/Isolated**: O(n) per pawn

### King Safety
- **Evaluation Time**: O(1) - Fixed 3x3 area checks
- **Attack Counting**: O(k) where k = nearby enemy pieces

### Piece Coordination
- **Coordination Check**: O(n²) where n = number of pieces
- **Battery Detection**: O(m²) where m = number of major pieces
- **Support Calculation**: O(n²) in worst case
- **Clustering Check**: O(n*49) = O(n) with constant 7x7 areas

**Note**: All performance characteristics are acceptable for a 9x9 Shogi board with typical piece counts.

## Integration

All Phase 1 features are fully integrated into the evaluation engine:

```rust
fn evaluate_material_and_position(&self, board: &BitboardBoard, player: Player) -> TaperedScore {
    // Uses piece-square tables ✅
    let positional_value = self.piece_square_tables.get_value(piece_type, pos, player);
}

fn evaluate_pawn_structure(&self, board: &BitboardBoard, player: Player) -> TaperedScore {
    // Implemented in position_features ✅
    // Evaluates: chains, advancement, isolation, passed pawns, doubled pawns
}

fn evaluate_king_safety(&self, board: &BitboardBoard, player: Player) -> TaperedScore {
    // Implemented in position_features ✅
    // Evaluates: shelter, shield, attackers, exposure
}

fn evaluate_piece_coordination(&self, board: &BitboardBoard, player: Player) -> TaperedScore {
    // Enhanced implementation ✅
    // Evaluates: batteries, support, overprotection, clustering, coordinated attacks
}
```
