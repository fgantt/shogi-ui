   - Bishop vs pawns: +60eg (if pawns not advanced), +10eg (if advanced)
   - Evaluates pawn advancement level
   - Critical for endgame conversion

5. **Fortress Patterns**:
   - Detects defensive structures in corners/edges
   - Counts defenders around king (Gold/Silver = 2 points, Pawn = 1 point)
   - High value when materially behind:
     - Significant disadvantage (<-500): +120eg
     - Moderate disadvantage (<0): +60eg
   - Helps evaluate defensive resources
