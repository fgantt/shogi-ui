## Introduction

Tapered Evaluation represents one of the most sophisticated and effective optimizations in modern game tree search algorithms. Based on the observation that different evaluation criteria are important at different phases of the game, tapered evaluation adjusts the relative weights of evaluation features based on the current game phase.

The core insight is profound: instead of using fixed evaluation weights throughout the game, we can dynamically adjust the importance of different factors based on the current position characteristics. This allows the engine to focus on the most relevant aspects of the position at each stage of the game.

This technique can provide significant improvements in playing strength, particularly in positions where the game phase is unclear or transitioning between phases.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Game Phase Classification

Games can be divided into distinct phases:
1. **Opening**: Piece development, control of center
2. **Middlegame**: Tactical play, piece activity
3. **Endgame**: King activity, pawn promotion, material balance

### Evaluation Feature Importance

Different evaluation features are important at different phases:
- **Material**: Always important, but more critical in endgame
- **Piece Activity**: Most important in middlegame
- **King Safety**: Critical in opening and middlegame
- **Pawn Structure**: Important throughout, but crucial in endgame

### The Tapering Principle

Tapered evaluation smoothly transitions between phase-specific evaluations:
```
E(position) = w_opening × E_opening(position) + 
              w_middlegame × E_middlegame(position) + 
              w_endgame × E_endgame(position)
```

Where the weights sum to 1 and change based on position characteristics.

### Phase Transition Smoothness

The transition between phases should be smooth to avoid evaluation discontinuities:
```
w_opening + w_middlegame + w_endgame = 1
w_opening, w_middlegame, w_endgame ≥ 0
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### Phase Weight Calculation

The phase weights are calculated based on position characteristics:

```
phase = f(material, piece_count, king_safety, pawn_structure)
```

Where f is a function that maps position features to phase values.

### Linear Interpolation

For smooth transitions, linear interpolation is used:

```
w_opening = max(0, min(1, (opening_phase - phase) / transition_width))
w_middlegame = max(0, min(1, 1 - |phase - middlegame_phase| / transition_width))
w_endgame = max(0, min(1, (phase - endgame_phase) / transition_width))
```

### Non-Linear Interpolation

For more sophisticated transitions, non-linear interpolation can be used:

```
w_opening = sigmoid((opening_phase - phase) / transition_width)
w_middlegame = gaussian(phase, middlegame_phase, transition_width)
w_endgame = sigmoid((phase - endgame_phase) / transition_width)
```

### Evaluation Function Design

Each phase-specific evaluation function focuses on relevant features:

```
E_opening(position) = material + development + center_control + king_safety
E_middlegame(position) = material + piece_activity + tactics + king_safety
E_endgame(position) = material + king_activity + pawn_structure + promotion
```

## Algorithm Design

### Basic Tapered Evaluation

```
function TaperedEvaluation(position):
    phase = CalculatePhase(position)
    weights = CalculateWeights(phase)
    
    opening_eval = OpeningEvaluation(position)
    middlegame_eval = MiddlegameEvaluation(position)
    endgame_eval = EndgameEvaluation(position)
    
    return (weights.opening * opening_eval + 
            weights.middlegame * middlegame_eval + 
            weights.endgame * endgame_eval)
```

### Phase Calculation

```
function CalculatePhase(position):
    material_factor = CalculateMaterialFactor(position)
    piece_count_factor = CalculatePieceCountFactor(position)
    king_safety_factor = CalculateKingSafetyFactor(position)
    pawn_structure_factor = CalculatePawnStructureFactor(position)
    
    phase = (material_factor * 0.3 + 
             piece_count_factor * 0.3 + 
             king_safety_factor * 0.2 + 
             pawn_structure_factor * 0.2)
    
    return phase
```

### Weight Calculation

```
function CalculateWeights(phase):
    if phase < 0.3:
        return {opening: 1.0, middlegame: 0.0, endgame: 0.0}
    elif phase < 0.7:
        opening_weight = (0.7 - phase) / 0.4
        middlegame_weight = (phase - 0.3) / 0.4
        endgame_weight = 0.0
        return {opening: opening_weight, middlegame: middlegame_weight, endgame: endgame_weight}
    else:
        middlegame_weight = (1.0 - phase) / 0.3
        endgame_weight = (phase - 0.7) / 0.3
        opening_weight = 0.0
        return {opening: opening_weight, middlegame: middlegame_weight, endgame: endgame_weight}
```

### Smooth Transition

```
function SmoothTransition(phase, transition_width):
    opening_weight = max(0, min(1, (0.5 - phase) / transition_width))
    middlegame_weight = max(0, min(1, 1 - abs(phase - 0.5) / transition_width))
    endgame_weight = max(0, min(1, (phase - 0.5) / transition_width))
    
    // Normalize weights
    total = opening_weight + middlegame_weight + endgame_weight
    return {opening: opening_weight / total, 
            middlegame: middlegame_weight / total, 
            endgame: endgame_weight / total}
```

## Phase Detection Strategies

### Material-Based Detection

Uses material balance to determine game phase:

```
function MaterialBasedPhase(position):
    total_material = CalculateTotalMaterial(position)
    if total_material > 0.8:
        return 0.0  // Opening
    elif total_material > 0.4:
        return 0.5  // Middlegame
    else:
        return 1.0  // Endgame
```

### Piece Count Detection

Uses piece count to determine game phase:

```
function PieceCountBasedPhase(position):
    piece_count = CountPieces(position)
    if piece_count > 20:
        return 0.0  // Opening
    elif piece_count > 12:
        return 0.5  // Middlegame
    else:
        return 1.0  // Endgame
```

### King Safety Detection

Uses king safety to determine game phase:

```
function KingSafetyBasedPhase(position):
    king_safety = CalculateKingSafety(position)
    if king_safety > 0.7:
        return 0.0  // Opening
    elif king_safety > 0.3:
        return 0.5  // Middlegame
    else:
        return 1.0  // Endgame
```

### Hybrid Detection

Combines multiple factors for phase detection:

```
function HybridPhase(position):
    material_phase = MaterialBasedPhase(position)
    piece_phase = PieceCountBasedPhase(position)
    safety_phase = KingSafetyBasedPhase(position)
    
    return (material_phase * 0.4 + 
            piece_phase * 0.3 + 
            safety_phase * 0.3)
```
