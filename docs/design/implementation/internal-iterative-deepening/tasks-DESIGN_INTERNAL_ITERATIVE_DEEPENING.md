# Task List: Internal Iterative Deepening (IID) Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `src/types.rs` - Contains IID configuration and statistics structures, EngineConfig integration
- `src/search.rs` - Main implementation of IID logic, integration with negamax_with_context, move ordering
- `tests/iid_tests.rs` - Unit tests for IID configuration, trigger conditions, and basic functionality
- `tests/iid_integration_tests.rs` - Integration tests with existing search features (LMR, null move, aspiration windows)
- `tests/iid_performance_tests.rs` - Performance benchmarks and efficiency measurements
- `tests/iid_optimization_tests.rs` - Adaptive tuning and configuration optimization tests

### Notes

- Unit tests should follow the existing pattern used in other search feature tests (lmr_tests.rs, aspiration_window_tests.rs)
- Use `cargo test iid` to run IID-specific tests
- Performance tests should include both efficiency benchmarks and playing strength comparisons
- Integration tests should verify compatibility with existing search features

  - [x] 5.2 Track IID move effectiveness in main search loop (alpha improvements, cutoffs)

  - [x] 5.6 Add reset_iid_stats() method for statistics clearing
