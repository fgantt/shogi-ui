## Introduction

Internal Iterative Deepening (IID) represents one of the most sophisticated and effective optimizations in modern game tree search algorithms. Based on the observation that good move ordering is crucial for alpha-beta pruning efficiency, IID uses shallow searches to find the best move at each node, then uses that move to order the full-depth search.

The core insight is profound: instead of relying on static move ordering heuristics, we can use actual search results to determine move quality. By searching moves at reduced depth first, we can identify the most promising moves and search them first at full depth, maximizing the chances of early cutoffs.

This technique can provide speedups of 20-40% in typical game positions, making it one of the most effective search optimizations available in modern engines.

## Fundamental Concepts

### The Move Ordering Problem

Alpha-beta pruning efficiency depends critically on move ordering:
- **Best moves first**: Maximize cutoff probability
- **Worst moves last**: Minimize search cost
- **Quality ordering**: Monotonic decrease in move quality

### The IID Insight

Instead of using static heuristics for move ordering, IID uses actual search results:
1. **Search moves at reduced depth** to get quality estimates
2. **Sort moves by search results** to get accurate ordering
3. **Search moves at full depth** in quality order

### The Iterative Deepening Principle

IID applies iterative deepening at each node:
- **Depth 1**: Search all moves at depth 1
- **Depth 2**: Search all moves at depth 2
- **Depth 3**: Search all moves at depth 3
- **Continue** until reaching the target depth

### The Search Cost Trade-off

IID trades search cost for move ordering quality:
- **Additional cost**: Extra shallow searches
- **Benefit**: Better move ordering and more cutoffs
- **Net result**: Overall speedup despite extra work

## Mathematical Foundation

### Move Quality Estimation

Let Q(m, d) be the quality of move m at depth d. IID estimates quality as:
```
Q(m, d) = Search(m, d - R)
```

Where R is the reduction factor (typically 1-3 plies).

### Ordering Accuracy

The accuracy of IID ordering depends on:
1. **Reduction factor R**: Smaller R gives more accurate estimates
2. **Search depth d**: Deeper searches give better estimates
3. **Position characteristics**: Some positions are harder to order

### Expected Search Cost

The expected search cost with IID is:
```
E[Cost] = Cost(IID) + Cost(FullSearch)
```

Where:
- Cost(IID) = cost of shallow searches
- Cost(FullSearch) = cost of full-depth search with better ordering

### Optimal Reduction Factor

The optimal reduction factor R* minimizes total search cost:
```
R* = argmin(E[Cost])
```

This typically results in R* = 1-3 plies.

## Algorithm Design

### Basic IID Algorithm

```
function AlphaBeta(position, depth, alpha, beta):
    if depth <= 0:
        return QuiescenceSearch(position, alpha, beta)
    
    moves = GenerateMoves(position)
    
    // Apply IID if beneficial
    if ShouldUseIID(position, depth, moves):
        moves = OrderMovesWithIID(position, moves, depth)
    
    for move in moves:
        new_position = MakeMove(position, move)
        score = -AlphaBeta(new_position, depth - 1, -beta, -alpha)
        
        if score >= beta:
            return beta  // Beta cutoff
        
        if score > alpha:
            alpha = score
    
    return alpha
```

### IID Move Ordering

```
function OrderMovesWithIID(position, moves, depth):
    reduction = CalculateReduction(depth)
    target_depth = depth - reduction
    
    // Search all moves at reduced depth
    move_scores = []
    for move in moves:
        new_position = MakeMove(position, move)
        score = -AlphaBeta(new_position, target_depth, -beta, -alpha)
        move_scores.append((move, score))
    
    // Sort moves by score (descending)
    move_scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    return [move for move, score in move_scores]
```

### Reduction Calculation

```
function CalculateReduction(depth):
    if depth <= 2:
        return 0  // No IID for shallow depths
    
    if depth <= 4:
        return 1  // 1 ply reduction
    
    if depth <= 6:
        return 2  // 2 ply reduction
    
    return 3  // 3 ply reduction for deep searches
```

### IID with Verification

```
function IIDWithVerification(position, moves, depth):
    reduction = CalculateReduction(depth)
    target_depth = depth - reduction
    
    // Search all moves at reduced depth
    move_scores = []
    for move in moves:
        new_position = MakeMove(position, move)
        score = -AlphaBeta(new_position, target_depth, -beta, -alpha)
        move_scores.append((move, score))
    
    // Sort moves by score
    move_scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    // Verify top moves at full depth
    verified_moves = []
    for move, score in move_scores:
        if len(verified_moves) < MAX_VERIFICATION_MOVES:
            new_position = MakeMove(position, move)
            full_score = -AlphaBeta(new_position, depth, -beta, -alpha)
            verified_moves.append((move, full_score))
        else:
            verified_moves.append((move, score))
    
    return [move for move, score in verified_moves]
```

## Move Ordering Strategies

### Static Ordering

Uses static heuristics for move ordering:

```
function StaticOrdering(moves):
    return sorted(moves, key=lambda m: GetMoveValue(m), reverse=True)
```

**Advantages**:
- Simple to implement
- Fast execution
- Predictable behavior

**Disadvantages**:
- Not adaptive to position
- May be inaccurate
- Limited by heuristic quality

### IID Ordering

Uses search results for move ordering:

```
function IIDOrdering(position, moves, depth):
    reduction = CalculateReduction(depth)
    target_depth = depth - reduction
    
    move_scores = []
    for move in moves:
        new_position = MakeMove(position, move)
        score = -AlphaBeta(new_position, target_depth, -beta, -alpha)
        move_scores.append((move, score))
    
    return sorted(move_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

**Advantages**:
- Adaptive to position
- More accurate ordering
- Better cutoff rates

**Disadvantages**:
- Additional search cost
- More complex implementation
- May not always be beneficial

### Hybrid Ordering

Combines static and IID ordering:

```
function HybridOrdering(position, moves, depth):
    // Use static ordering for initial estimate
    static_ordered = StaticOrdering(moves)
    
    // Use IID for refinement
    if ShouldUseIID(position, depth, moves):
        return IIDOrdering(position, static_ordered, depth)
    else:
        return static_ordered
```

### Adaptive Ordering

Adjusts ordering strategy based on position characteristics:

```
function AdaptiveOrdering(position, moves, depth):
    if IsTacticalPosition(position):
        return IIDOrdering(position, moves, depth)
    elif IsEndgamePosition(position):
        return StaticOrdering(moves)
    else:
        return HybridOrdering(position, moves, depth)
```

## Performance Analysis

### Theoretical Speedup

The theoretical speedup from IID depends on:

1. **Ordering improvement**: How much better IID ordering is
2. **Cutoff rate increase**: How many more cutoffs occur
3. **Search cost**: Additional cost of shallow searches
4. **Position characteristics**: How much IID helps

Expected speedup:
```
Speedup = 1 / (1 + Cost(IID) / Cost(FullSearch) - Improvement(Cutoffs))
```

### Empirical Performance

Typical performance gains:
- **Chess**: 20-40% speedup
- **Shogi**: 15-35% speedup
- **Go**: 10-30% speedup

### Quality Impact

IID can improve search quality by:
- **Better move ordering**: More accurate move selection
- **More cutoffs**: Earlier termination of bad branches
- **Better evaluation**: More accurate position assessment

### Memory Impact

IID affects:
- **Transposition Table**: More hits due to better ordering
- **Move Ordering**: Better move ordering from previous iterations
- **Cache Efficiency**: Improved locality of reference

## Advanced Techniques

### Selective IID

Only apply IID when beneficial:

```
function SelectiveIID(position, depth, moves):
    if not ShouldUseIID(position, depth, moves):
        return StaticOrdering(moves)
    
    return IIDOrdering(position, moves, depth)
```

### Multi-Level IID

Use different reduction factors for different depths:

```
function MultiLevelIID(position, moves, depth):
    if depth > 8:
        reduction = 3
    elif depth > 6:
        reduction = 2
    elif depth > 4:
        reduction = 1
    else:
        return StaticOrdering(moves)
    
    return IIDOrdering(position, moves, depth, reduction)
```

### IID with Learning

Learn from search history to improve IID decisions:

```
function LearningIID(position, moves, depth):
    if HasSimilarPosition(position):
        return UseLearnedOrdering(position, moves)
    else:
        return IIDOrdering(position, moves, depth)
```

### IID with Pruning

Combine IID with other pruning techniques:

```
function IIDWithPruning(position, moves, depth):
    // Apply IID for ordering
    ordered_moves = IIDOrdering(position, moves, depth)
    
    // Apply additional pruning
    pruned_moves = PruneMoves(ordered_moves, position, depth)
    
    return pruned_moves
```

## Practical Considerations

### When to Use IID

**Good candidates**:
- Sufficient search depth (> 4-5 plies)
- Many moves to order
- Non-tactical positions
- Positions where move ordering matters

**Poor candidates**:
- Tactical positions
- Very shallow search depths
- Few moves to order
- Positions where static ordering is sufficient

### Tuning Parameters

Key parameters to optimize:

1. **Reduction Factor**: How much depth to reduce
2. **IID Threshold**: When to use IID
3. **Verification Limit**: How many moves to verify
4. **Position Adaptation**: How to adjust for position type
5. **Memory Management**: How to handle IID state

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Too Aggressive Reduction**: Inaccurate ordering
2. **Insufficient Verification**: Missing good moves
3. **Poor Position Detection**: Using IID inappropriately
4. **Memory Leaks**: Accumulating state across searches
5. **Performance Overhead**: Excessive IID cost

### Debugging Techniques

1. **Logging**: Track IID decisions and results
2. **Statistics**: Monitor ordering quality and performance
3. **Verification**: Compare with and without IID
4. **Test Suites**: Use known positions to test accuracy
5. **Profiling**: Measure performance impact
