# Theory of Advanced Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Overview

Advanced alpha-beta pruning techniques are sophisticated optimizations that reduce the search tree size in game engines by intelligently skipping moves that are unlikely to improve the current best score. These techniques build upon the basic alpha-beta algorithm to achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining search correctness.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Alpha-Beta Pruning Basics

Alpha-beta pruning is a search algorithm that eliminates branches in the game tree that cannot possibly influence the final decision. It maintains two values:

- **Alpha**: The minimum score that the maximizing player is assured of
- **Beta**: The maximum score that the minimizing player is assured of

When alpha â‰¥ beta, the current branch can be pruned because the opponent will not choose this path.

### Search Tree Characteristics

In game engines, the search tree exhibits several characteristics that make advanced pruning effective:

1. **Move Ordering**: Better moves are typically searched first
2. **Position Evaluation**: Static evaluation provides position strength estimates
3. **Depth Dependencies**: Deeper searches are more expensive but more accurate
4. **Move Types**: Different move types have different likelihoods of being good

## Advanced Pruning Techniques

### 1. Late Move Reduction (LMR)

**Concept**: Moves searched later in the move list are statistically less likely to be good, so they can be searched with reduced depth.

**Theory**:
- Move ordering places better moves first
- Later moves are less likely to cause beta cutoffs
- Reduced depth search is faster but less accurate
- Re-search with full depth if reduced search shows promise

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
If move_number > threshold AND depth > threshold AND not_capture AND not_promotion:
    reduction = base_reduction + (move_number / 8) + (depth / 4)
    search_depth = depth - 1 - reduction
```

**Benefits**:
- Significant reduction in search tree size
- Maintains tactical accuracy through re-search
- Adapts to position characteristics

### 2. Futility Pruning

**Concept**: In quiet positions, moves that cannot improve the current best score by a sufficient margin can be skipped.

**Theory**:
- Static evaluation provides position strength estimate
- Quiet moves (non-captures, non-promotions) have limited impact
- Futility margin accounts for evaluation uncertainty
- Check detection prevents pruning in tactical positions

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
If depth <= futility_depth_limit AND not_in_check AND quiet_move:
    If static_eval + futility_margin[depth] < alpha:
        Skip move
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces search in quiet positions
- Preserves tactical accuracy
- Depth-dependent margins account for search uncertainty

### 3. Delta Pruning

**Concept**: Capture moves that cannot improve the position by a sufficient margin can be pruned.

**Theory**:
- Capture moves have immediate material impact
- Material gain can be calculated statically
- Delta margin accounts for positional factors
- Only applies to capture moves

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
If capture_move:
    material_gain = captured_piece_value - moving_piece_value
    If static_eval + material_gain + delta_margin < alpha:
        Skip move
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces search of poor captures
- Maintains material accuracy
- Simple and effective heuristic

### 4. Razoring

**Concept**: In quiet positions near the search horizon, reduce search depth and re-search if promising.

**Theory**:
- Deep searches are expensive
- Quiet positions have limited tactical content
- Razoring provides early termination
- Re-search ensures accuracy for promising positions

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
If depth <= razoring_depth_limit AND not_in_check:
    If static_eval + razoring_margin < alpha:
        razor_depth = 1
        razor_score = search(razor_depth)
        If razor_score >= beta: return beta
        If razor_score > alpha: re-search with full depth
```

**Benefits**:
- Early termination in quiet positions
- Maintains accuracy through re-search
- Significant performance improvement

## Pruning Decision Framework

### Decision Factors

1. **Position Characteristics**:
   - Check status
   - Material balance
   - Position type (opening, middlegame, endgame)

2. **Move Characteristics**:
   - Move type (capture, promotion, quiet)
   - Move value (material gain/loss)
   - Move ordering position

3. **Search Context**:
   - Current depth
   - Alpha-beta window
   - Move number in list

### Pruning Safety

**Safety Conditions**:
- Never prune in check
- Never prune capture moves in futility pruning
- Always re-search promising positions
- Use conservative margins

**Validation**:
- Tactical sequences must be preserved

## Advanced Techniques

### Extended Futility Pruning

**Concept**: Extend futility pruning to deeper levels with adjusted margins.

**Theory**:
- Deeper searches have more uncertainty
- Larger margins needed for deeper levels
- More aggressive pruning possible

**Implementation**:
```
If depth <= extended_futility_depth_limit:
    margin = futility_margin[depth] * depth_multiplier
    If static_eval + margin < alpha: Skip move
```

### Multi-Cut Pruning

**Concept**: If multiple moves fail to improve alpha, the position is likely bad.

**Theory**:
- Multiple failed moves indicate poor position
- Can prune remaining moves with confidence
- Requires careful validation

**Implementation**:
```
failed_moves = 0
for move in moves:
    if search(move) <= alpha:
        failed_moves += 1
        if failed_moves >= multi_cut_threshold:
            return alpha
```

### Probabilistic Pruning

**Concept**: Use probability estimates to make pruning decisions.

**Theory**:
- Move quality can be estimated probabilistically
- Low-probability moves can be pruned
- Maintains statistical accuracy

**Implementation**:
```
move_probability = estimate_move_quality(move, position)
if move_probability < pruning_threshold:
    Skip move
```
