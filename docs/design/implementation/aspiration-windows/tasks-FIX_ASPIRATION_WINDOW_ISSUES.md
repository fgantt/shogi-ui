# Task List: Fix Aspiration Window Critical Issues

## Overview

This document outlines the critical fixes needed for the aspiration window implementation based on log analysis that revealed:
1. Aspiration window search completely failing at depth 3
2. Move tracking returning `best_move=None` despite having a score
3. Insufficient logging for debugging search issues
4. Inadequate retry logic for edge cases

## Relevant Files

- `src/search.rs` - Main search engine implementation with aspiration window logic
- `src/debug_utils.rs` - Debug logging utilities for tracing
- `src/types.rs` - Configuration and statistics structures
- `tests/aspiration_window_tests.rs` - Unit tests for aspiration window functionality
- `tests/aspiration_window_integration_tests.rs` - Integration tests

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Aspiration Window Complete Failure
**Problem**: Search fails completely instead of widening window and retrying
**Location**: `src/search.rs` lines 5147-5152
**Impact**: Search falls back to previous depth results instead of completing intended depth

### Issue 2: Move Tracking Bug
**Problem**: `search_at_depth` returns `best_move=None` despite having a score
**Location**: `src/search.rs` line 2089 and move evaluation logic
**Impact**: Inconsistent search results and potential engine crashes

### Issue 3: Insufficient Debug Logging
**Problem**: Limited visibility into move evaluation and best move selection
**Location**: Throughout `search_at_depth` and aspiration window logic
**Impact**: Difficult to debug search issues and performance problems

### Issue 4: Inadequate Retry Logic
**Problem**: Aspiration window retry logic doesn't handle all edge cases
**Location**: `src/search.rs` aspiration window loop and retry methods
**Impact**: Search may fail unnecessarily or get stuck in loops
