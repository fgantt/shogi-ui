### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `feature_extractor.rs` and `feature_extractor.rs` in the same directory).
- Use `cargo test` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Cargo configuration.
- The tuning system will be implemented as a separate binary to avoid impacting the main engine's performance.
