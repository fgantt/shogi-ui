### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `simd_bitboard.rs` and `simd_bitboard_test.rs` in the same directory).
- Use `cargo test` to run tests. Use `cargo bench` to run performance benchmarks.
- SIMD implementation requires conditional compilation with `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` for WebAssembly and fallback for other targets.
- Feature flags will be used to enable/disable SIMD functionality: `simd` and `simd-native`.
