<h1>The Universal Shogi Interface</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This document contains Tord Romstadt's original description of the
Universal Shogi Interface, a protocol for communication between
a shogi engine and GUI, supplemented with some extensions introduced
by the authors of the Shogidogoro GUI.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    For beginning shogi programmers, a standard protocol with
    supporting GUIs considerably reduces the amount of work required
    to write a shogi program.  Instead of having to write a complete
    graphical application, they can write their shogi program as a
    simple console mode program, and plug this little program into an
    existing GUI.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the majority of shogi programs support a standard protocol, it
    becomes easy to run automatic tournament and matches between shogi
    programs.  This is very useful for programmers, because a big
    number of games is often necessary in order to decide whether some
    change to a shogi program improves the strength.
  </li>
  <li>
    Portability between different operating systems becomes much
    easier when the engine is separated from the GUI.  Porting a
    graphical application from Windows to Linux or Mac OS X is usually
    a big programming task, but simple text-mode programs can often be
    ported almost without any work.  If all platforms have at least
    one GUI conforming to the protocol, a shogi programmer can make
    her program run on all platforms without doing much more than
    recompiling for each platform.
  </li>
  <li>
    For users of shogi software, a standardized protocol would make it
    possible to run several shogi engines in a single graphical
    interface.  Instead of having to switch from one GUI to another
    whenever they want to use a different shogi program, they can use
    their favorite shogi GUI all the time, and load individual engines
    into the GUI.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The USI protocol, as well as the textual description on the protocol
below, is based on
the 

<a href="https://download.shredderchess.com/div/uci.zip">UCI protocol</a> 

used in computer chess.  Almost all the current top computer chess
programs support the UCI protocol, and compatible GUIs exist for
Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
</p>

<p>
I am grateful to Stefan Meyer Kahlen, the author of the UCI protocol,
for allowing me to use his work as the basis for my shogi protocol.
Most of the text in section 5 below is copied verbatim from the
official UCI protocol description.
</p>

<h2>2. Some notes about language</h2>
<p>
All communication between the engine and the GUI is done by 7-bit
ASCII text, and the English language is used in the names of the
various commands.  English letters are used to denote the various
piece types ("P" for pawn, "L" for lance, etc.).  This may seem like a
strange choice (at least to non-technical users), considering that the
vast majority of users of shogi software are Japanese.
</p>
<p>
The justification for the use of 7-bit ASCII is to make the work
easier for the engine programmer.  Most shogi engines are written in
low-level programming languages like C, where reading and writing
Unicode is difficult, especially while trying to maintain
portability.  Translation of the move output from the engine into
Japanese notation is assumed to be the responsibility of the GUI.
</p>
<p>
A USI engine may also have several engine parameters which can be
configured by the user (e.g. style of play, piece values for the
various pieces, different kinds of search parameters, and so on).
Each parameter has an internal name in 7-bit ASCII which is used in
all communication between the engine and the GUI.  An USI engine
should, in addition to the executable file, be delivered with a
Unicode text file containing Japanese translations (and optionally
translations into other languages) of all option names.  The GUI
should use the translations in this file when displaying the options
to the user.
</p>
<p>
The format of the translations file is not yet decided, and will be
described in a future version of this document.
</p>

<h2>3. Forsyth-Edwards notation for shogi</h2>
<p>
In computer chess, there is a standardized compact ASCII notation for
chess positions, known as the Forsyth-Edwards notation (usually
abbreviated as FEN).  It was originally invented by David Forsyth more
than 100 years ago, and was extended for use with chess software by
Steven Edwards some time in the 1990s.  For a precise definition of
the FEN standard, consult section 16.1 of the 

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326001450/http://www.yacdb.com/pgn/pgn_1616.htm#SEC16.1">PGN
  specification.</a>
</p>
<p>
As far as I know, no equivalent standard exists for shogi (please
correct me if I am wrong).  This section describes a variant of FEN
notation suitable for shogi.
</p>
<p>
A Shogi FEN string (SFEN from now on) consists of a single line of
ASCII text containing four data fields, separated by whitespace.
These are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Board state.</b>  The placement of the pieces of the board is
    written rank by rank, with each rank separated by a slash ('/').
    The ranks are ordered from the white side, beginning with rank 'a'
    and ending with rank 'i' (using the standard English shogi board
    coordinates).  For each rank, the squares are specified from file
    9 to file 1.  The uppercase letters "PLNSGBRK" are used for the
    non-promoted black pieces, while the lowercase letters "plnsgbrk"
    are used for the non-promoted white pieces.  A promoted piece is
    denoted by a '+' character immediately before the piece letter,
    e.g. +B for a black promoted bishop.  One or more contiguous empty
    squares are represented by a digit counting the number of squares.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The side to move.</b>  This field contains of a single letter,
    "b" (for "black") or "w" (for "white"), depending on the current
    side to move.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Pieces in hand.</b>.  Again we use uppercase letters for black
    pieces, and lowercase letters for white's captured pieces.  A
    digit before a letter means that there are several pieces of the
    given type in hand.  The pieces are always listed in the order
    rook, bishop, gold, silver, knight, lance, pawn; and with all
    black pieces before all white pieces.  As an example, in a
    position where black has one rook, one gold and four pawns in hand, while
    white has two bishops, two silvers and three pawns, the pieces in
    hand data field in the SFEN would look like "RG4P2b2s3p".  If
    neither player has any pieces in hand, a single minus character
    ("-") is used for the pieces in hand field.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Move count.</b> An integer representing the number of the
    current move in the game.  We are using the shogi convention for
    move counting, which means that we count what international
    players would call "plies" or "half moves".  For instance, after
    the moves 1. P7g-7f 2. P8c-8d, the move counter is 3.  The "move
    count" data field is optional; a program should be able to read
    and understand an SFEN string even if this field is missing.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
As an example, the initial position in shogi is encoded like this:
</p>
<tt>lnsgkgsnl/1r5b1/ppppppppp/9/9/9/PPPPPPPPP/1B5R1/LNSGKGSNL b - 1</tt>
<p>
A more complicated example is the following position, taken from the
3rd game of the 19th Ryu-O match between Sato and Watanabe:
</p>
<pre><tt>
  9    8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    | Lw | a    1B 1G 1N 3P
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|    | Lw |+Rb |    |    | Pb |    |    |    | b
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| Pw |    |    | Pw | Bb | Gb |    | Pw | Pw | c
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| Kw | Pw | Sw |    | Pw |    |    |    |    | d
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| Nb | Nw |    | Pb |    |    | Gb |    |    | e
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| Pb |    | Pb |    | Pb |    |    | Pb | Pb | f
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|    | Pb | Sb |    |    |    |    |    |    | g
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|    | Kb | Sb | Gb |    |    |    |+Rw |    | h
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| Lb | Nb |    |    |+Pw |    |    |    | Lb | i    1S 
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
</tt></pre>
<p>
The SFEN for the position above is:
</p>
<tt>
8l/1l+R2P3/p2pBG1pp/kps1p4/Nn1P2G2/P1P1P2PP/1PS6/1KSG3+r1/LN2+p3L w Sbgn3p 124
</tt>

<p>
The SFEN notation described above differs from the FEN notation for
chess positions in a few ways.  The castling and en passant fields
have been removed, for the obvious reason that castling and en passant
captures do not exist in shogi.  The halfmove clock has been removed
because shogi has no 50-move draw rule.  Finally, because captured
pieces can be dropped back on the board in shogi, the "pieces in hand"
data field has been added.
</p>

<h2>4. Differences between the UCI and USI protocols</h2>
<p>
This section is intended for programmers who are already familiar with
the UCI protocol.  Those who do not know anything about UCI are
adviced to skip to section 5.
</p>
<p>
The USI protocol is identical to the USI protocol apart from the
following changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    An UCI engine consists of only the executable file, but an USI
    engine should contain a separate "translation file", a Unicode
    text file containing translations of the engine and author names
    and all the parameter names into one or more languages.  The
    format for the translation file is not yet decided.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spaces are not allowed in option names.  This fixes a small defect
    in the UCI protocol:  In a UCI chess engine, there are certain
    words (most notably "type") which cannot be used in option names
    because it would cause ambiguity.  The only advantage of allowing
    spaces in option names is that it makes the names look
    cosmetically nicer in the GUI, and this advantage disappears in
    USI because the GUI will not display the option name, but the
    translation found for this option name in the translation file.
    For instance, if the engine has an option named "NULL_MOVE_R", the
    translation file can contain an English translation like "Null move
    reduction factor", and it is this translation that will be
    displayed in the GUI (assuming that the user has set English as
    her preferred language).
  </li>
  <li>
    A new option type, "filename", has been added.  This is identical
    to the "string" option type, except for the way it is presented in
    the GUI.  For "filename" options, the GUI will display a file
    browser, while for "string" options, it will let the user type a
    string.  The new option type is intended to be used for selecting
    opening book files and similar tasks. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of FEN strings, SFEN strings (as described in section 3)
    are used.  Where UCI uses <tt>position fen &lt;fen&gt;</tt>, USI
    uses <tt>position sfen &lt;sfen&gt;</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moves are written in coordinate notation, using the standard
    English shogi coordinates with the upper right corner (white's
    left corner) as square 1a and the lower left corner (black's left
    corner) as square 9i.  Normal moves are written exactly as in UCI,
    except for the different coordinates (e.g. 7g7f).  Promotions are
    written with an extra '+' character at the end of the move
    (e.g. 4e3c+).  Drops are written as a piece letter in upper case,
    followed by a star ('*'), and the destination square (e.g. P*3d).
  </li>
  <li>
    Mate scores are always sent using the shogi convention for move
    counting: We count plies, not full moves.  Where you would
    send <tt>info score mate 3</tt> in a UCI engine, you should
    send <tt>info score mate 5</tt> in a USI engine.
  </li>
  <li>
    All options with fixed semantics start with the
    prefix <tt>USI_</tt>.  For instance, the option which is
    named <tt>Hash</tt> in UCI is named <tt>USI_Hash</tt> in USI.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Description of the universal shogi interface</h2>

<h3>5.1. General rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The specification is independent of the operating system. For
    Windows, the engine is a normal exe file, either a console or
    "real" windows application.
  </li>
  <li>
    All communication is done via standard input and output with text
    commands.
  </li>
  <li>
    The engine should boot and wait for input from the GUI, the engine
    should wait for the <tt>isready</tt> or <tt>setoption</tt> command
    to set up its internal parameters as the boot process should be as
    quick as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    The engine must always be able to process input from stdin, even
    while thinking.
  </li>
  <li>
    All command strings the engine receives will end with '\n', also
    all commands the GUI receives should end with '\n'.  Note: '\n'
    can be 0x0d or 0x0a0d or any combination depending on your OS.  If
    you use the engine and GUI in the same OS this should be no
    problem if you communicate in text mode, but be aware of this when
    for example running a Linux engine in a Windows GUI.
  </li>
  <li> 
    Arbitrary white space between tokens is allowed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The engine will always be in forced mode which means it should
    never start calculating or pondering without receiving
    a <tt>go</tt> command first.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before the engine is asked to search on a position, there will
    always be a position command to tell the engine about the current
    position.
  </li>
  <li>
    By default all the opening book handling is done by the GUI, but
    there is an option for the engine to use its own book
    (<tt>USI_OwnBook</tt> option, see below).
  </li>
  <li>
    If the engine or the GUI receives an unknown command or token it
    should just ignore it and try to parse the rest of the string in
    this line. Examples: <tt>joho debug on\n</tt> should switch the
    debug mode on given that joho is not defined, <tt>debug joho on\n</tt>
    will be undefined however.
  </li>
  <li>
    if the engine receives a command which is not supposed to come,
    for example <tt>stop</tt> when the engine is not calculating, it
    should also just ignore it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2. Move format</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Normal (i.e. non-promoting, non-dropping moves) are written in
    English coordinate notation, using only the source and destination
    squares, without any piece letters or other characters (for
    instance <tt>7g7f</tt>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Promotion moves are written just like normal moves, except that an
    extra '+' character at the end of the move (for
    instance <tt>4e3c+</tt>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Drops are written with the English piece letter in upper case
    followed by a star (<tt>*</tt>) and the destination square (for
    instance <tt>P*3d</tt>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>5.3. GUI to engine</h3>
<p>
These are all the command the engine gets from the interface.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>usi</tt></dt> 
  <dd>
    <p>
    Tell engine to use the USI (universal shogi interface). This will
    be sent once as a first command after program boot to tell the
    engine to switch to USI mode.  After receiving the <tt>usi</tt>
    command the engine must identify itself with the <tt>id</tt>
    command and send the <tt>option</tt> commands to tell the GUI
    which engine settings the engine supports.  After that, the engine
    should send <tt>usiok</tt> to acknowledge the USI mode.  If
    no <tt>usiok</tt> is sent within a certain time period, the engine
    task will be killed by the GUI.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>debug [ on | off ]</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Switch the debug mode of the engine on and off.  In debug mode the
    engine should send additional infos to the GUI, e.g. with the
    <tt>info string</tt> command, to help debugging, e.g. the commands
    that the engine has received etc.  This mode should be switched
    off by default and this command can be sent any time, also when
    the engine is thinking.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>isready</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    This is used to synchronize the engine with the GUI. When the GUI
    has sent a command or multiple commands that can take some time to
    complete, this command can be used to wait for the engine to be
    ready again or to ping the engine to find out if it is still
    alive. This command is also required once before the engine is
    asked to do any search to wait for the engine to finish
    initializing.  This command must always be answered
    with <tt>readyok</tt> and can be sent also when the engine is
    calculating in which case the engine should also immediately
    answer with <tt>readyok</tt> without stopping the search.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>setoption name &lt;id&gt; [value &lt;x&gt;]</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    This is sent to the engine when the user wants to change the
    internal parameters of the engine. For the <tt>button</tt> type no
    value is needed. One string will be sent for each parameter and
    this will only be sent when the engine is waiting. The name and
    value of the option in <tt>&lt;id&gt;</tt> should not be case
    sensitive and can not include spaces.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>register</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This is the command to try to register an engine or to tell the
      engine that registration will be done later. This command should
      always be sent if the engine has sent <tt>registration
      error</tt> at program startup.
    </p>
    <p>
    The following tokens are allowed:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>later</tt></dt>
      <dd>The user doesn't want to register the engine now.</dd>

      <dt><tt>name &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	The engine should be registered with the
	name <tt>&lt;x&gt;</tt>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>code &lt;y&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	The engine should be registered with the
	code <tt>&lt;y&gt;</tt>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
	"register later"
	"register name Stefan MK code 4359874324"
    </tt></pre>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>usinewgame</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    This is sent to the engine when the next search (started with
    <tt>position</tt> and <tt>go</tt>) will be from a different
    game. This can be a new game the engine should play or a new game
    it should analyse but also the next position from a testsuite with
    positions only.  As the engine's reaction to <tt>usinewgame</tt>
    can take some time the GUI should always send <tt>isready</tt> after
    <tt>usinewgame</tt> to wait for the engine to finish its
    operation.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt>
    <tt>
      position [sfen &lt;sfenstring&gt; | startpos ]  moves &lt;move1&gt; ... &lt;movei&gt;
    </tt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Set up the position described in sfenstring on the internal
      board and play the moves on the internal board.  If the game was
      played from the start position, the string <tt>startpos</tt>
      will be sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: If this position is from a different game than the last
      position sent to the engine, the GUI should have sent a
      <tt>usinewgame</tt> inbetween.
  </p></dd>


  <dt><tt>go</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Start calculating on the current position set up with the
      <tt>position</tt> command. There are a number of commands that
      can follow this command, all will be sent in the same string.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one command is not sent its value should be interpreted as if
      it would not influence the search.
    </p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>searchmoves &lt;move1&gt; ... &lt;movei&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  Restrict search to this moves only
	</p>
	<p>
	  Example: After <tt>position startpos</tt> and <tt>go
	  infinite searchmoves 7g7f 2g2f</tt>, the engine should only
	  search the two moves P-7f and P-2f in the initial position.
	</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>ponder</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	Start searching in pondering mode. Do not exit the search in
	ponder mode, even if it's mate! This means that the last move
	sent in in the position string is the ponder move. The engine
	can do what it wants to do, but after a <tt>ponderhit</tt>
	command it should execute the suggested move to ponder
	on. This means that the ponder move sent by the GUI can be
	interpreted as a recommendation about which move to
	ponder. However, if the engine decides to ponder on a
	different move, it should not display any mainlines as they
	are likely to be misinterpreted by the GUI because the GUI
	expects the engine to ponder on the suggested move.
	</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>btime &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>Black has x milliseconds left on the clock</dd>

      <dt><tt>wtime &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>White has x milliseconds left on the clock</dd>

      <dt><tt>binc &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>Black increment per move i milliseconds if x &gt; 0.</dd>

      <dt><tt>winc &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>White increment per move i milliseconds if x &gt; 0.</dd>

      <dt><tt>byoyomi &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>(Shogidogoro) Amount (in milliseconds) the clocks are allowed
	to go negative before the player is flagged (which by default would be 0).
	Negative times left on the clock will be reset to 0 for the next turn.</dd>

      <dt><tt>movestogo &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	There are x moves to the next time control. This will only be
	sent if x &gt; 0. If you don't get this and get the <tt>wtime</tt> and
	<tt>btime</tt>, it's sudden death.
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>depth &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>Search <tt>x</tt> plies only.</dd>

      <dt><tt>nodes &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>Search <tt>x</tt> nodes only.</dd>

      <dt><tt>mate &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	Original proposal was: Search for a mate in <tt>x</tt> (half)moves.
	In Shogidogoro this has been changed to <tt>x</tt> being a time
	specification rather than a depth,
	either a number indicating milliseconds, or the word <tt>infinite</tt>.
	And such a search would have its own dedicated set of replies,
	different from other <tt>go</tt> commands (see the <tt>checkmate</tt> command).
	<br>
	The command also seems largely redundant,
	as even engines that do have a special tsume search mode could activate this
	whenever they get to search on a position where one side lacks a King,
	and there already are plenty options on the <tt>go</tt> command to control
	thinking time.
	The solution could then be reported through the usual <tt>info pv</tt> commands,
	and failure through a <tt>bestmove resign</tt> command.
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>movetime &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>Search exactly x milliseconds.</dd>

      <dt><tt>infinite</tt></dt>

  <dt><tt>stop</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Stop calculating as soon as possible. Don't forget the

      finishing the search.
    </p>
  </dd>
    
  <dt><tt>ponderhit</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The user has played the expected move. This will be sent if the
      engine was told to ponder on the same move the user has
      played. The engine should continue searching but switch from
      pondering to normal search.

<h3>5.3. Engine to GUI</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>id</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>name &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	This must be sent after receiving the <tt>usi</tt> command to
	identify the engine, e.g. <tt>id name Shredder X.Y\n</tt>
      </dd>
      <dt><tt>author &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	This must be sent after receiving the <tt>usi</tt> command to
	identify the engine, e.g. <tt>id author Stefan MK\n</tt>
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>usiok</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Must be sent after the id and optional options to tell the GUI
    that the engine has sent all infos and is ready in usi mode.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>readyok</tt></dt> 
  <dd>
    <p>
    This must be sent when the engine has received an <tt>isready</tt>
    command and has processed all input and is ready to accept new
    commands now.  It is usually sent after a command that can take
    some time to be able to wait for the engine, but it can be used
    anytime, even when the engine is searching, and must always be
    answered with <tt>readyok</tt>.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>bestmove &lt;move1&gt; [ponder &lt;move2&gt;]</tt></dt>
  <dt><tt>bestmove [resign | win]</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    The engine has stopped searching and found the
    move <tt>&lt;move&gt;</tt> best in this position. The engine can
    send the move it likes to ponder on. The engine must not start
    pondering automatically.  this command must always be sent if the
    engine stops searching, also in pondering mode if there is
    a <tt>stop</tt> command, so for every <tt>go</tt> command
    a <tt>bestmove</tt> command is needed!
    ((Shogidogoro) except after the combination "go mate",
    where this must be a <tt>checkmate</tt> command instead.)
    Directly before that the
    engine should send a final <tt>info</tt> command with the final
    search information, the the GUI has the complete statistics about
    the last search.
    </p>
    <p>
    (Shogidogoro) Engines can resign a game by sending a <tt>bestmove</tt>
    command with the word <tt>resign</tt> instead of a valid move. To claim
    a win the word <tt>win</tt> can be used similarly.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>checkmate [&lt;move1&gt; ... &lt;movei&gt; | nomate | timeout | notimplemented]</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    (Shogidogoro) Sent when a "go mate" search terminates, instead
    of a <tt>bestmove</tt> command, to convey the main line of the solution
    rather than just a single move.
    If it could be proven no solution exists, the word <tt>nomate</tt>
    will be sent instead of a main line,
    while <tt>timeout</tt> here would indicate the search was inconclusive.
    Finally, engines that do not implement the "go mate" function should reply
    to it with <tt>checkmate notimplemented</tt>.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>copyprotection</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This is needed for copyprotected engines. After the usiok
      command the engine can tell the GUI, that it will check the copy
      protection now. This is done by <tt>copyprotection
      checking</tt>.  If the check is ok the engine should
      send <tt>copyprotection ok</tt>, otherwise <tt>copyprotection
      error</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is an error the engine should not function properly but
      should not quit alone. If the engine reports <tt>copyprotection
      error</tt> the GUI should not use this engine and display an
      error message instead!
    </p>
    <p>
      The code in the engine can look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
	TellGUI("copyprotection checking\n");
	// ... check the copy protection here ...
	if(ok)
	  TellGUI("copyprotection ok\n");
	else
          TellGUI("copyprotection error\n");
    </tt></pre>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>registration</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This is needed for engines that need a username and/or a code to
      function with all features. Analogously to the <tt>copyprotection</tt>
      command the engine can send <tt>registration checking</tt> after the
      usiok command followed by either <tt>registration ok</tt> or
      <tt>registration error</tt>.  Also after every attempt to
      register the engine it should answer with <tt>registration
      checking</tt> and then either <tt>registration ok</tt>
      or <tt>registration error</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast to the <tt>copyprotection</tt> command, the GUI can
      use the engine after the engine has reported an error, but
      should inform the user that the engine is not properly
      registered and might not use all its features.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition the GUI should offer to open a dialog to enable
      registration of the engine. To try to register an engine the GUI
      can send the <tt>register</tt> command. The GUI has to always
      answer with the <tt>register</tt> command if the engine
      sends <tt>registration error</tt> at engine startup (this can
      also be done with <tt>register later</tt>) and tell the user
      somehow that the engine is not registered.  This way the engine
      knows that the GUI can deal with the registration procedure and
      the user will be informed that the engine is not properly
      registered.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>info</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The engine wants to send information to the GUI. This should be
      done whenever one of the info has changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine can send only selected infos or multiple infos with
      one info command, e.g. <tt>info currmove 2g2f currmovenumber
      1</tt> or <tt>info depth 12 nodes 123456 nps 100000</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also all infos belonging to the pv should be sent together, e.g.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
	info depth 2 score cp 214 time 1242 nodes 2124 nps 34928 pv 2g2f 8c8d 2f2e
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
      I suggest to start sending <tt>currmove</tt>, <tt>currmovenumber</tt>,
      <tt>currline</tt> and <tt>refutation</tt> only after one second
      in order to avoid too much traffic.
    </p>

      </dd>

     <dt><tt>hashfull &lt;x&gt;</tt></dt>
     <dd>
       The hash is x permill full. The engine should send this info

     </dd>

     <dt><tt>refutation &lt;move1&gt; &lt;move2&gt; ... &lt;movei&gt;</tt></dt>
     <dd>
       Move <tt>&lt;move1&gt;</tt> is refuted by the
       line <tt>&lt;move2&gt; ... &lt;movei&gt;</tt>, where i can be
       any number &gt;= 1. Example: after move 8h2b+ is searched, the
       engine can send <tt>info refutation 8h2b+ 1c2b</tt> if 1c2b is
       the best answer after 8h2b+ or if 1c2b refutes the move 8h2b+. If
       there is no refutation for 8h2b+ found, the engine should just
       send <tt>info refutation 8h2b+</tt>. The engine should only send
       this if the option
       <tt>USI_ShowRefutations</tt> is set to true.
     </dd>

     <dt><tt>currline &lt;cpunr&gt; &lt;move1&gt; ... &lt;movei&gt;</tt></dt>
     <dd>
       This is the current line the engine is
       calculating. <tt>&lt;cpunr&gt;</tt> is the number of the cpu if
       the engine is running on more than one
       cpu. <tt>&lt;cpunr&gt;</tt> = 1,2,3....  If the engine is just
       using one cpu, <tt>&lt;cpunr&gt;</tt> can be omitted.
       If <tt>&lt;cpunr&gt;</tt> is greater than 1, always send all k
       lines in k strings together. The engine should only send this
       if the option <tt>USI_ShowCurrLine</tt> is set to true.
     </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>


  <dt><tt>option</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This command tells the GUI which parameters can be changed in
      the engine.  This should be sent once at engine startup after
      the <tt>usi</tt> and the <tt>id</tt> commands if any parameter
      can be changed in the engine.  The GUI should parse this and
      build a dialog for the user to change the settings.  Note that
      not every option should appear in this dialog, as some options
      like <tt>USI_Ponder</tt>, <tt>USI_AnalyseMode</tt>, etc. are
      better handled elsewhere or are set automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user wants to change some settings, the GUI will send a
      <tt>setoption</tt> command to the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the GUI need not send the setoption command when
      starting the engine for every option if it doesn't want to
      change the default value. For all allowed combinations see the
      examples below, as some combinations of this tokens don't make
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      One string will be sent for each parameter.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><tt>name &lt;id&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  The option has the name <tt>&lt;id&gt;</tt>.  Whitespace is
	  not allowed in an option name.  Note that the name should
	  normally not be displayed directly in the GUI: The GUI
	  should look up the option name in the translation file, and
	  present the translation into the users preferred language in
	  the engine's option dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Certain options have a fixed value for &lt;id&gt;, which
	  means that the semantics of this option is fixed. Usually
	  those options should not be displayed in the normal engine
	  options window of the GUI but get a special
	  treatment. <tt>USI_Pondering</tt> for example should be set
	  automatically when pondering is enabled or disabled in the
	  GUI options. The same for <tt>USI_AnalyseMode</tt> which
	  should also be set automatically by the GUI. All those
	  certain options have the prefix <tt>USI_</tt>. If the GUI
	  gets an unknown option with the prefix <tt>USI_</tt>, it
	  should just ignore it and not display it in the engine's
	  options dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The options with fixed semantics are:
	</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_Hash</tt>, type spin</dt>
	  <dd>
	    The value in MB for memory for hash tables can be changed,
	    this should be answered with the first <tt>setoptions</tt>
	    command at program boot if the engine has sent the
	    appropriate <tt>option name Hash</tt> command, which
	    should be supported by all engines!  So the engine should
	    use a very small hash first as default.
	  </dd>
	  
	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_Ponder</tt>, type check</dt>
	  <dd>
	    This means that the engine is able to ponder (i.e. think
	    during the opponent's time). The GUI will send this
	    whenever pondering is possible or not. Note: The engine
	    should not start pondering on its own if this is enabled,
	    this option is only needed because the engine might change
	    its time management algorithm when pondering is allowed.
	  </dd>
	  
	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_OwnBook</tt>, type check</dt>
	  <dd>
	    This means that the engine has its own opening book which
	    is accessed by the engine itself. If this is set, the
	    engine takes care of the opening book and the GUI will
	    never execute a move out of its book for the engine. If
	    this is set to false by the GUI, the engine should not
	    access its own book.
	  </dd>
	  
	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_MultiPV</tt>, type spin</dt>
	  <dd>
	    The engine supports multi best line or k-best mode. The
	    default value is 1.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_ShowCurrLine</tt>, type check</dt>
	  <dd>
	    The engine can show the current line it is
	    calculating. See <tt>info currline</tt> above.  This
	    option should be false by default.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_ShowRefutations</tt>, type check</dt> 
	  <dd>
	    The engine can show a move and its refutation in a
	    line. See <tt>info refutations</tt> above.  This option
	    should be false by default.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_LimitStrength</tt>, type check</dt> 
	  <dd>
	    The engine is able to limit its strength to a specific
	    dan/kyu number. This should always be implemented together
	    with <tt>USI_Strength</tt>.  This option should be false
	    by default.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_Strength</tt>, type spin</dt> 
	  <dd>
	    The engine can limit its strength within the given
	    interval.  Negative numbers are kyu levels, while positive
	    numbers are amateur dan
	    levels. If <tt>USI_LimitStrength</tt> is set to false,
	    this value should be ignored.
	    If <tt>USI_LimitStrength</tt> is set to true, the engine
	    should play with this specific strength. This option should
	    always be implemented together with
	    <tt>USI_LimitStrength</tt>.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>&lt;id&gt; = USI_AnalyseMode</tt>, type check</dt> 
	  <dd>
	    The engine wants to behave differently when analysing or
	    playing a game. For example when playing it can use some
	    kind of learning, or an asymetric evaluation function.
	    The GUI should set this option to false if the engine is
	    playing a game, and to true if the engine is analysing.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>type &lt;t&gt;</tt></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  The option has type <tt>t</tt>. There are 5 different types
	  of options the engine can send:
	</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt><tt>check</tt></dt>
	  <dd>
	    A checkbox that can either be true or false.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>spin</tt></dt>
	  <dd>
	    A spin wheel or slider that can be an integer in a certain
	    range.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>combo</tt></dt>
	  <dd>
	    A combo box that can have different predefined strings as
	    a value.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>button</tt></dt>
	  <dd>
	    A button that can be pressed to send a command to the
	    engine
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>string</tt></dt>
	  <dd>
	    A text field that has a string as a value, an empty string
	    has the value <tt>&lt;empty&gt;</tt>.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><tt>filename</tt></dt>
	  <dd>
	    Similar to <tt>string</tt>, but is presented as a file

<h3>5.4. Examples</h3>
<p>
  This is how the communication when the engine boots can look like:
</p>

<pre><tt>

GUI     engine
// tell the engine to switch to USI mode
usi

// engine identify  

        id name Glaurung Shogi 0.1

// the engine can switch off Nullmove and set the playing style

        option name Nullmove type check default true
        option name Style type combo default Normal var Solid var Normal var Risky
// the engine has sent all parameters and is ready

        usiok

// Note: here the GUI can already send a "quit" command if it just
// wants to find out details about the engine, so the engine should
// not initialize its internal parameters before here.

// now the GUI sets some values in the engine

// set hash to 128 MB

setoption name USI_Hash value 128

// set play style to "Solid"

setoption name Style value Solid


// waiting for the engine to finish initializing

// this command and the answer is required here!

isready

// engine has finished setting up the internal values

        readyok

// now we are ready to go

// if the GUI is supporting it, tell the engine that is is
// searching on a game that it hasn't searched on before

usinewgame

// if the engine supports the "USI_AnalyseMode" option and the next
// search is supposed to be an analysis, the GUI should set
// "USI_AnalyseMode" to true if it is currently set to false with this
