## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### **Using the Engine API**
```rust
use shogi_engine::ShogiEngine;

let mut engine = ShogiEngine::new();

// Get best move
if let Some(best_move) = engine.get_best_move(depth, time_limit, None) {
    println!("Best move: {}", best_move.to_usi_string());
}

// Check engine status
println!("Debug mode: {}", engine.is_debug_enabled());
println!("Opening book loaded: {}", engine.is_opening_book_loaded());
```

### **Leveraging Existing Features**
- **Debug Logging**: Use `crate::debug_utils` for detailed analysis
- **Evaluation System**: Access tapered evaluation components
- **Search Engine**: Utilize iterative deepening and PVS
- **Opening Book**: Load and query opening positions
- **Tablebase**: Probe endgame positions

### **Future: USI Engine Abstraction**
To make these utilities more generally useful beyond our specific engine implementation:

**Current State:** Utilities are tightly integrated with `ShogiEngine` struct and use direct API calls for performance and functionality.

**Future Enhancement:** Add a USI engine abstraction layer to support any USI-compatible engine:

```rust
// Proposed abstraction
trait UsiEngine {
    fn get_best_move(&mut self, depth: u32, time_limit: Duration) -> Option<Move>;
    fn analyze_position(&mut self, sfen: &str, depth: u32) -> Analysis;
    // ... other common operations
}

// Implementation for our engine
impl UsiEngine for ShogiEngine { /* ... */ }

// Implementation for external USI engines via subprocess
struct UsiProtocolEngine {
    process: Child,
    // communication via USI protocol
}
impl UsiEngine for UsiProtocolEngine { /* ... */ }
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works with any USI-compatible engine (YaneuraOu, elmo, etc.)
- ✅ Allows users to choose their preferred engine for analysis
- ✅ Enables comparing different engines
- ✅ Makes utilities more universally useful

**Current Priority:** Keep direct integration for now as it provides:
- Better performance (no process overhead)
- Access to internal state and debugging features
- Simpler implementation and maintenance
- Immediate functionality for our use case

**Migration Path:** When ready to generalize:
1. Create trait abstraction
2. Implement trait for our engine (trivial)
3. Add USI subprocess wrapper
4. Make utilities engine-agnostic
5. Add `--engine` flag to utilities to choose engine

This can be done incrementally without breaking existing functionality.

### **File Format Support**
- **KIF**: Japanese notation format
- **CSA**: Computer Shogi Association format
- **PGN**: Portable Game Notation
- **JSON**: Structured data format
- **SFEN**: Shogi Forsyth-Edwards Notation
