## Project Status Summary (2025-07-29)

### Overall Goal
Develop a Shogi game UI with improved user experience and visual feedback.

### Key Decisions, Technical Requirements, and Strategic Direction

*   **Game Logic Enhancements:**
    *   Implemented `getLegalDrops` function in `src/game/engine.js` to accurately calculate valid drop squares for captured pieces.
    *   Integrated `getLegalDrops` into `src/App.jsx` for state management and UI highlighting.
    *   Refined AI (Easy mode) in `src/ai/computerPlayer.js` to prevent illegal moves that would put its own King in check.

*   **User Interface & Experience (UI/UX) Improvements:**
    *   Implemented deselection logic for both board pieces and captured pieces in `src/App.jsx`, allowing users to click/drag a selected item again to deselect it.
    *   Introduced semitransparent highlight overlays for board squares (`legal-move`, `in-check`, `last-move`) in `src/styles/shogi.css` and `src/components/Board.jsx` for enhanced visual feedback.
    *   Implemented dynamic background wallpapers for the application, randomly selected from `/public/wallpapers/`.
    *   Implemented dynamic board backgrounds, randomly selected from `/public/boards/`.
    *   Adjusted board square dimensions to `width: 70px` and `height: 76px` across `src/styles/shogi.css` and `src/components/SvgPiece.jsx`, along with all related UI element dimensions (e.g., `.column-numbers`, `.row-numbers`, `.board`, `.captured-pieces`, `.move-log`).
    *   Assigned unique SVG `piecePath` values for each piece type in `src/components/SvgPiece.jsx` to allow for distinct visual representations.
    *   Applied `wood-bambo.jpg` as a fill pattern for all `SvgPiece` components, enhancing the visual aesthetic of the pieces.

### Next Steps (Implied from recent actions and goals)

*   Verify the visual appearance and functionality of the implemented features in the UI.
*   Continue to refine UI/UX based on testing and feedback.
*   Explore further enhancements to AI difficulty levels.
