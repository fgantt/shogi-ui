## Project Status Summary - August 4, 2025

### Recent Accomplishments:

- **AI Opening Book:** Implemented and expanded the AI's opening book, allowing it to make pre-defined moves in the early game. A console log message is now displayed when a move is chosen from the opening book.
- **Startup Game Settings:** Added a new startup popup dialog that allows players to select the AI difficulty, which player moves first (human player), and the piece set (Kanji or International).
- **Player Role Handling:** Fixed a critical bug where the AI was moving the wrong pieces when the user selected to play as Player 2. The game now correctly identifies and manages human and AI player roles.
- **Piece Animation Fix:** Resolved a visual bug where Player 2's pieces were animating incorrectly upon selection.
- **Console Log Silencing:** Silenced unnecessary console logs in the AI worker and Board components for a cleaner development experience.
- **Game State Reset:** Ensured that all board highlighting and relevant game state variables are properly reset when a new game is started, preventing visual artifacts from previous games.
- **Collapsible Settings Sections:** Made the "Board Background" and "Wallpaper" sections in the Settings Panel collapsible, and set them to start in a collapsed state for a cleaner UI.

### Current Challenges/Known Issues:

- None at this time.

### Next Steps:

- Continue to monitor for any new bugs or issues.
- Explore further enhancements to AI difficulty levels and game features as outlined in the PRD.
