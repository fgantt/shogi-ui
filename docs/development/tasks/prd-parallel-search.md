# Product Requirements Document: Parallel Search Implementation

## 1. Introduction/Overview

### Problem Statement
The current Shogi engine search implementation is single-threaded, utilizing only one CPU core even on modern multi-core systems. This limits search depth and playing strength, as the engine cannot take advantage of available hardware parallelism.

### Goal
Implement parallel search using the Young Brothers Wait Concept (YBWC) algorithm with work-stealing to enable multi-threaded search across multiple CPU cores. The implementation must maintain full compatibility with all existing search features (LMR, null move pruning, IID, aspiration windows, transposition tables, tablebase, opening book) and achieve at least 3x speedup on 4-core systems.

### Current State
- Single-threaded search implementation using `SearchEngine`
- `ThreadSafeTranspositionTable` already exists and supports concurrent access
- Comprehensive search optimizations already implemented (LMR, null move, IID, aspiration windows)
- Iterative deepening search orchestration via `IterativeDeepening` struct
- Stop flag mechanism using `Arc<AtomicBool>` for search interruption
- Engine configuration system via `EngineConfig` struct

### Target State
- Multi-threaded search using YBWC algorithm with work-stealing
- Configurable thread count via USI option (default: auto-detect CPU cores)
- Default enabled for native builds (no WASM support needed)
- Graceful fallback to single-threaded on errors with warning logs
- All existing tests updated and passing
- No compiler warnings
- Zero stubbed code

## 2. Goals

1. **Performance**: Achieve minimum 3x speedup on 4-core systems compared to single-threaded search
2. **Correctness**: Maintain search quality equivalent to single-threaded (same move quality, minor non-determinism acceptable)
3. **Integration**: Full compatibility with all existing search features and optimizations
4. **Reliability**: Graceful error handling with automatic fallback to single-threaded mode
5. **Usability**: Transparent operation with configurable thread count via USI protocol
6. **Quality**: Zero compiler warnings, all tests passing, no stubbed code

## 3. User Stories

1. **As an engine user**, I want the engine to automatically use multiple CPU cores so that searches complete faster and achieve greater depth
2. **As a competitive player**, I want to configure thread count so that I can optimize performance for my hardware
3. **As a developer**, I want parallel search to work seamlessly with all existing features so that the engine remains stable and reliable
4. **As a user**, I want the engine to continue working even if parallel search encounters issues, so that I'm never left without a functional engine
5. **As a tester**, I want comprehensive test coverage so that parallel search correctness is verifiable

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Parallel Search Functionality

**FR-1**: The system must implement Young Brothers Wait Concept (YBWC) algorithm with work-stealing for parallel search.

**FR-2**: The system must support configurable thread count via USI option `USI_Threads` with the following specifications:

- Range: 1 to 32
- Usage: `setoption name USI_Threads value 4`

**FR-3**: The system must default to parallel search enabled in native builds (thread count > 1 enables parallel search).

**FR-4**: The system must maintain a shared `ThreadSafeTranspositionTable` accessible by all worker threads.

**FR-5**: The system must support thread-local search contexts (board state, move generator, evaluator) to avoid contention.

**FR-6**: The system must implement work-stealing queue for load balancing across threads.

**FR-7**: The system must respect the global stop flag (`Arc<AtomicBool>`) across all threads, allowing timely search interruption.

**FR-8**: The system must aggregate search results from all threads to determine the best move and score.

**FR-17**: Parallel search must work correctly with the existing iterative deepening (`IterativeDeepening`) orchestration.

**FR-18**: All threads must respect the time limit constraints and stop flag during search.

### 4.3 Thread Safety and Synchronization

**FR-19**: All access to the shared transposition table must be thread-safe using existing `ThreadSafeTranspositionTable` mechanisms.

**FR-20**: The system must use thread pools (via `rayon` crate) for efficient thread management.

**FR-21**: The system must minimize lock contention through appropriate locking strategies (read locks for TT probes, write locks for TT stores).

**FR-22**: The system must handle thread-local search statistics and aggregate them at search completion.

**FR-23**: The system must ensure board state cloning is efficient for thread-local search copies.

### 4.4 Error Handling and Fallback

**FR-27**: The system must handle synchronization errors gracefully (fallback to single-threaded with logging).

**FR-28**: The system must ensure search never fails due to parallelization - always return a valid move result.

### 4.5 Configuration and API

**FR-36**: The system must have synchronization overhead < 10% of total search time.

**FR-37**: The system must compile without any warnings.

**FR-38**: The system must have zero stubbed code (all functions fully implemented).

**FR-39**: The system must pass all existing tests (updated as necessary for parallelism).

**FR-40**: The system must include new test suites specifically for parallel search correctness and performance.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **GPU Acceleration**: GPU-based search is out of scope for this implementation.

2. **Distributed Search**: Network-based multi-machine search is not included.

3. **NUMA Optimization**: NUMA-aware thread and memory placement is deferred to future enhancements.

4. **Adaptive Threading**: Dynamic thread count adjustment during search based on position characteristics is not included (fixed thread count per search session).

5. **WASM Support**: WASM compatibility is explicitly not required (project no longer supports WASM).

6. **Alternative Algorithms**: Implementation of PVS or pure Lazy SMP variants (only YBWC is in scope).

7. **Memory Pool Optimization**: Advanced memory pool allocation patterns beyond standard Rust allocation is deferred.

8. **Split Point Management**: Advanced split point coordination beyond YBWC work-stealing is not included.

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Algorithm Choice: Young Brothers Wait Concept (YBWC)

YBWC is selected because it:
- Provides good load balancing through work-stealing
- Scales well with thread count
- Integrates naturally with existing alpha-beta search
- Allows efficient use of shared transposition table
- Supports proper move ordering across threads

### 6.2 Integration Points

**Primary Integration Point**: `IterativeDeepening::search()` - This is where parallel search should be invoked, replacing or enhancing the single-threaded search call.

**Search Engine Integration**: `SearchEngine` needs to support parallel context creation for each thread (board cloning, context initialization).

**Transposition Table**: Existing `ThreadSafeTranspositionTable` already supports concurrent access - no changes needed.

**Stop Flag**: Existing `Arc<AtomicBool>` stop flag mechanism works across threads - minimal changes needed.

### 6.3 Dependencies

**Required Crate**: `rayon` - For thread pool management and parallel iterators.
- Version: Latest stable (1.8+)
- Purpose: Thread pool, parallel iteration, work-stealing

**Existing Dependencies** (no changes needed):
- `num_cpus` - Already in `Cargo.toml` for CPU core detection
- `std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, RwLock}` - Standard library synchronization primitives

### 6.4 Thread Safety Architecture

```

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Thread Safety Requirements

1. **Transposition Table**: Use existing `ThreadSafeTranspositionTable` which already implements `RwLock` for safe concurrent access.

2. **Board State**: Each thread must have its own cloned `BitboardBoard` instance for search. Board cloning should be efficient.

3. **Move Generator**: Each thread uses its own `MoveGenerator` instance (no shared mutable state).

4. **Evaluator**: Each thread uses its own `PositionEvaluator` instance (immutable configuration, thread-safe).

5. **Move Ordering**: Thread-local history tables and killer moves, but can read TT results from shared table.

6. **Statistics**: Thread-local statistics aggregated at end of search (use `Mutex` for aggregation).

7. **Stop Flag**: `Arc<AtomicBool>` is already thread-safe - all threads check the same flag.

### 7.2 Memory Considerations

1. **Board Cloning**: Each thread needs a full board clone - memory usage scales with thread count.

2. **Transposition Table**: Shared table size should be increased proportionally with thread count (recommended: 4MB per thread minimum).

3. **Work Queue**: Work-stealing queue has minimal memory overhead.

4. **Thread Stack**: Each thread has its own stack (default 2MB per thread) - ensure sufficient system memory.

### 7.3 Performance Optimizations

1. **Lock Granularity**: Use fine-grained locking in TT (per-bucket locks if possible, otherwise `RwLock` for entire table).

2. **Cache Affinity**: Consider pinning threads to CPU cores using thread affinity (future enhancement, not required).

3. **Work Distribution**: Implement intelligent work distribution to minimize thread idle time.

4. **TT Sharing**: Ensure TT reads are frequent (shared knowledge) while writes are coordinated to avoid cache line thrashing.

### 7.4 Search Quality Considerations

1. **Move Ordering**: Ensure consistent move ordering across threads for reproducible results when possible.

2. **TT Sharing**: Shared TT improves move ordering quality across threads (Lazy SMP effect).

3. **Non-Determinism**: Minor non-determinism is acceptable (same move quality, potentially different search paths).

### 7.5 Error Handling Strategy

1. **Thread Creation Failure**: Catch `rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder` errors, log warning, fall back to single-threaded.

2. **Panic Handling**: Use `rayon`'s panic handling to catch thread panics and fall back gracefully.

3. **OTC Lock Poisoning**: Handle `PoisonError` from mutex locks, log error, fall back to single-threaded.

4. **Time Limit Exceeded**: Stop flag mechanism handles this - all threads check flag regularly.

- Test suite infrastructure (criterion for benchmarks)

## 15. Timeline Estimate

Based on 12 feature-level checkpoints:

- **Checkpoints 1-3**: Foundation and basic parallel search (Week 1-2)
- **Checkpoints 4-6**: Feature integration (LMR, null move, IID, aspiration) (Week 2-3)
- **Checkpoints 7-8**: Tablebase, opening book, stop flag (Week 3-4)
- **Checkpoints 9-10**: Error handling, performance tuning (Week 4-5)
- **Checkpoints 11-12**: Testing, integration, final validation (Week 5-6)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6 weeks for complete implementation with all checkpoints.

**Note**: Each checkpoint must pass all validation criteria before proceeding to the next checkpoint.

## 16. Documentation Requirements

1. **Code Documentation**: All public APIs must have comprehensive doc comments explaining thread safety, error handling, and usage.

2. **Architecture Documentation**: Document the parallel search architecture, thread safety model, and integration points.

3. **Performance Guide**: Document performance characteristics, expected speedup, and tuning recommendations.

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Document common issues, debugging techniques, and fallback behavior.

## 17. Definition of Done

The parallel search implementation is considered complete when:

1. ✅ All 12 checkpoints pass validation criteria
2. ✅ All tests pass (existing + new parallel search tests)
3. ✅ Zero compiler warnings in release build
4. ✅ Zero stubbed code (all functions fully implemented)
5. ✅ Performance targets met (≥3x speedup on 4 cores)
6. ✅ Quality targets met (≥95% move match, no correctness issues)
7. ✅ Documentation complete (code docs + architecture docs)
8. ✅ Code review approved
9. ✅ Integration successful (default enabled, works transparently)
10. ✅ Error handling robust (graceful fallback, no crashes)
